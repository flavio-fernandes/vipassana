0:08 the sth day is
0:12 over you have now three more days left
0:16 to
0:19 work but to work
0:23 seriously you have only two more days
0:28 left because 10th
0:33 day after the sitting from 8 to
0:38 9 you will learn a new technique of
0:43 meditation and after
0:45 that the wow of silence is
0:50 over Noble silence no more noble silence
0:53 it will be Noble chattering
0:58 then chattering is chattering Noble or
1:01 not
1:03 Noble chattering and serious meditation
1:06 cannot coexist they can't go
1:09 together so you won't be able to
1:12 meditate seriously on the 10th
1:16 day and yet it is a very important
1:19 day very important day because for 9
1:23 days very deep operation very deep
1:26 surgical operation of the Mind
1:30 on the 10th day this deep wound will
1:33 require some Bal and the technique that
1:36 you will learn on that day will be a
1:39 very soothing Bal on the
1:42 wound and
1:44 moreover coming out of a very deep
1:47 operation coming out of silence for 9
1:51 days suddenly one comes to the outside
1:53 world comes in contact at
1:57 times people are very shocking
1:59 experience
2:00 so that 10 day 10th day is a shock
2:03 absorber for
2:06 you on the 11th day you can face the
2:09 world
2:12 better so for actual very serious
2:16 meditation the next two
2:21 days and budha wants you to meditate
2:26 continuously so far as this technique is
2:29 concerned continuity of practice is the
2:32 secret of
2:33 success people come for longer courses
2:36 20 days course 30 days 45
2:40 days they were
2:44 continuously you have recess periods but
2:47 there is no recess period for longterm
2:51 students you also to learn how to
2:53 practice continuously so for these two
2:57 days learn how to practice continuous
3:01 L during meditation periods of course
3:04 you sit with closed eyes and
3:07 meditate but what you call intervals are
3:10 no more intervals for you
3:15 now when you to do something at the
3:18 physical level you to get up and walk
3:21 walk to your residence walk to the
3:23 dining hall
3:25 Etc you are still meditating with open
3:28 eyes you aware
3:32 you just resting open eyes you are
3:35 aware you are aware of whatever we are
3:38 doing at the physical level if you are
3:39 walking you are aware you are walking if
3:42 you are eating you are aware you are
3:43 eating if you are bathing you are aware
3:45 you are Bing you're resting you're aware
3:47 you
3:48 resting but then along with that very
3:51 essential you are also aware of some
3:54 sensation or the other on the
3:57 body people have not understood Buddha
4:01 properly and they made it just awareness
4:04 of walking walking walking eating it has
4:07 its own Advantage but this is not
4:09 Buddha's teaching he wants you to be
4:12 always aware of the sensation either
4:15 respiration or
4:17 sensation if you miss sensation then you
4:20 miss the deepest part of your
4:23 mind and you have to rectify the deepest
4:26 part of the mind you to change the
4:27 behavior pattern of the deepest part
4:31 so sensation awareness of sensation is
4:33 very
4:34 important while you are walking it is
4:36 not necessary and at this stage not
4:39 possible also that you can feel the
4:41 whole body sensation on the whole body
4:43 at least on the moving part if you are
4:45 walking you aware of Sensations on your
4:48 legs if you are eating you're aware of
4:50 Sensations on your fingertips the mouth
4:54 touches the food you are aware of the
4:55 sensation on the lips on the gums on the
4:57 tongue and as you swallow on the throat
5:00 whichever our moving part you have
5:04 Sensations sometimes you don't feel
5:05 sensation on the moving part that and
5:07 then any part but somewhere on the body
5:10 you must be feeling a sensation and
5:12 along with that you are aware of
5:14 whatever physical activity is going on
5:17 that is during recess
5:20 periods then you have a continuity
5:23 meditation hours you sit closed eyes
5:25 meditate rest of the period you open and
5:28 do whatever is necessary to be done at
5:30 the physical level and you are still
5:31 meditating because you are aware of your
5:33 activities and you are aware of the
5:36 sensations night time you go to bed
5:39 closed eyes you're lying
5:41 down lying down you are aware of every
5:44 movement of your body you feel like
5:46 turning on one side and you are aware
5:48 you're turning on the one side and then
5:49 you turn on the other side you're aware
5:51 of everything that is happening at the
5:53 physical level along with that you are
5:55 aware of
5:56 Sensations not necessary again to move
6:00 from head to feet in order or feet to
6:02 head in order you are lying down any
6:05 sensation arises anywhere you are a bear
6:08 so some sensation or the other anywhere
6:10 on the body and as you are aware of
6:13 sensation aware of sensation you get
6:14 sleep deep sleep very good night is for
6:17 deep sleep next day morning as you
6:20 awaken you feel Sensations again you
6:23 start with the
6:26 sensations quite possible at times a see
6:29 student may not get a deep sleep half
6:32 asleep half awaken very good and in some
6:36 cases whole night no sleep wonderful
6:39 whole night no sleep but you keep lying
6:42 down closed eyes no sleep doesn't matter
6:44 and you are aware of sensation aware of
6:47 sensation if you start
6:50 worrying oh look no sleep 12:00 No Sleep
6:55 1:00 no sleep 2:00 No Sleep the next day
6:59 you come up as a sick
7:01 person you are not PR you're not
7:03 practicing
7:05 V but you just aware of your sensation
7:08 if no sensation aware of respiration
7:10 whole night and the mind is very Quin
7:14 next day you get up so
7:16 fresh as if you come out of very deep
7:18 sleep very deep
7:20 sleep after all nature wants you to
7:23 sleep only for two purpose one purpose
7:26 is to give rest to the body hold day the
7:29 body has been working now give rest
7:32 similarly whole day the mind was busy
7:34 here there give rest to the
7:36 mind so night time never sit and
7:39 meditate keep lying so you get full rest
7:42 to the body you give full rest to the
7:44 body and mind gets wonderful rest when
7:48 it is awakened aware and at the same
7:51 time
7:52 equinus it gets so much rest so the
7:55 purpose is served the body gets full
7:56 rest the mind gets full rest next day
8:00 you're very fresh very
8:03 fresh there
8:05 are in all the Indian scriptures three
8:08 kinds of
8:10 uh situations are there either one is
8:14 awakened or one is in sleep or one is in
8:18 dream but there is a fourth situation
8:21 for the
8:23 yogis yogis does not mean those who do
8:26 this acrobatic exercises of Asa and
8:28 pranayama they not yogis Yogi is one who
8:33 attains communion with the ultimate
8:35 truth is a yogi B
8:39 Yogi now that is a
8:42 stage which is very high
8:45 stage you are
8:47 awakened not as a sick person you are
8:51 awakened with the reality of the
8:52 sensations within
8:54 you and keeping your mind perfectly
8:57 equinus perfectly equinus
9:00 that is why in many of the Scriptures it
9:01 is said the entire world
9:05 sleeps but the yogi remains awakened
9:07 awakened in this Sensations the reality
9:11 inside this does not mean that night
9:13 time you're getting sleep and you say I
9:15 won't sleep I'm a yogi that the world
9:18 sleep I will remain awaken that is going
9:20 to extreme if naturally you feel like
9:22 sleeping sleep but if you don't get
9:25 sleep and you are aware of Sensations
9:26 you are equanimous no worry don't have
9:29 any
9:30 anxiety you you are doing your job you
9:32 are just aware of the reality at the
9:34 level of Sensations and you're not
9:36 reacting you are equanimous you given
9:39 full rest to the mind you given full
9:41 rest to the body like this make use of
9:44 this remaining two days learn how to
9:49 practice Buddha says day and night only
9:52 when you are in deep Sleep you can't
9:53 help otherwise day and night continuous
9:56 continuous continuous
9:59 make a very deep surgical operation so
10:01 that in these two days you take out very
10:03 deep rooted complexes which are causes
10:07 for great misery for you let them come
10:09 out
10:10 now this is a wonderful time to get
10:13 liberated from those complexes and
10:15 continuity will help you storms might
10:18 come still but now having covered 7 days
10:22 you have strength to
10:24 face you're strong enough to face them
10:27 don't worry no no such s will come which
10:31 will make you very much
10:33 agitated those five
10:35 enemies five neas are still there but
10:39 they are becoming weaker weaker
10:41 weaker and you got five friends also
10:44 wonderful
10:45 friends keep them with you and you will
10:49 find that these friends are so helpful
10:51 to you these friends are really helpful
10:56 provided their purity is maintained
11:00 when they lose their purity these very
11:02 friends become our enemies and they
11:04 become very harmful who are our
11:08 friends what is their purity let us
11:12 understand five friends we
11:16 have the first
11:19 friend in the language of those days was
11:21 called sadha that means
11:24 devotion
11:26 Faith devotion faith
11:31 is a very important
11:33 friend one who does not have any
11:36 faith any
11:39 devotion in whatever one is working then
11:42 how can one work all the time doubtful
11:46 skeptical then one cannot work must have
11:50 confidence must have faith now Seven
11:53 Days Are Over by this time one should
11:55 have faith in the technique on the path
11:59 and can work much
12:02 better but this Faith this confidence
12:06 this devotion can become a very big
12:09 enemy if it becomes blind Blind Faith
12:14 blind devotion blind belief does not
12:17 help us they are big
12:19 enemies don't allow them to become blind
12:23 all these five friends if they become
12:25 blind they are useless they don't help
12:27 us in any way so along with this there
12:30 must be wisdom every friend must have
12:34 the wisdom with it so that you
12:36 understand the purity of this particular
12:40 friend the devotion purity of devotion
12:43 is only when your wisdom with devotion
12:46 without wisdom it will become
12:49 blind the wisdom is like our
12:52 eyes and devotion is like our
12:55 legs one who does not have eyes will
12:58 walk on the
13:00 path may even run on the path but will
13:03 not know when when he or she has taken
13:06 wrong
13:06 path one may fall down in a ditch
13:09 because no eyes one is only eyes and no
13:13 legs no devotion one will keep on
13:15 looking the path oh wonderful path so
13:17 wonderful so great Buddha's teaching is
13:20 so wonderful D is so wonderful but you
13:22 can't take one step on that because
13:24 you're no devotion you got no Fe both
13:26 are important the commun of these two
13:30 that gives us so much strength because
13:32 then the devotion
13:34 becomes enlightened
13:36 devotion a devotion with discriminatory
13:40 intelligence discriminatory wisdom then
13:42 you know what is the essence essence of
13:46 devotion you don't take it just blindly
13:49 what is the essence of devotion you may
13:52 have
13:53 devotion in anyone in any god goddess a
13:58 saintly person and enlightened
14:01 person why you have devotion in this
14:05 person in this being because this person
14:08 is sent person he has certain
14:11 qualities and the devotion is towards
14:13 the qualities you get
14:16 inspiration seeing those
14:18 qualities and then you get an
14:21 inspiration to develop those very
14:22 qualities in you then the devotion is
14:25 very helpful very helpful very
14:29 purposeful otherwise it doesn't help if
14:32 you just make
14:35 devotion with a begging ball you keep on
14:38 asking oh God Almighty please give me
14:40 this oh goddess please give me this this
14:43 desire must be fulfilled that desire
14:45 must be fulfilled that kind of devotion
14:47 is blind devotion it does not help
14:51 devotion for the qualities and getting
14:54 inspiration and developing those very
14:56 qualities is a wonderful devotion
15:01 an
15:02 instance again years
15:06 back during the early courses I gave in
15:09 India coming from
15:12 Burma a very old lady came to a
15:16 course took the course very seriously
15:18 worked very
15:20 seriously understood the technique
15:22 properly worked
15:24 properly and got wonderful
15:26 results going back home for one year she
15:29 continued to practice morning and
15:30 evening contined to apply this technique
15:33 in daily life and again she got much
15:35 more benefits after one year she came
15:38 again to get established more and more
15:41 in the technique in
15:43 dhama but she had an interview with
15:46 me and then told me that she has got one
15:51 fear in her mind what fear she says she
15:54 comes from the bti cult The Cult of
15:57 devotion and this is Gan Mar Gan Mar
16:00 means the the path of
16:03 wisdom although this will take to the
16:05 final goal I understand but I fear I
16:08 don't want to get out of my my devotion
16:12 that must remain and I fear by this
16:15 technique I will miss my my devotion and
16:19 I tell her oh no don't worry your your
16:22 devotion will become
16:24 stronger oh no no sir with this kind of
16:28 technique there is there is no place for
16:30 no place for
16:31 devotion and she won't
16:34 understand I told her all right do you
16:36 really
16:37 have faith in your God or your
16:40 goddess do you really have
16:43 confidence do you really have devotion
16:46 she
16:46 said
16:48 traditionally we are in this Cult of B
16:50 we got so much of devotion so much of
16:53 Faith so much of confidence in this God
16:55 or that
16:57 goddess then I question
16:59 her do you make promisory
17:02 offerings back in India it's very common
17:04 promisory offering what is a promary
17:07 offering say somebody is sick in the
17:09 family the head of the family the mother
17:12 or father will go to the temple bow down
17:15 to that god or goddess and then
17:18 say please cure my son or daughter
17:22 whoever and when she or he is cured I
17:26 will offer you sweets for 5 rupees worth
17:29 of
17:30 sweets do you make such promisory
17:32 offerings oh certainly this is very
17:35 common then you don't have faith in your
17:37 God you don't have faith in your goddess
17:40 first you must cure your son or daughter
17:43 then only you offer 5 rupes you don't
17:45 have even 5 rupees worth of faith in
17:48 your in your God or godess you won't
17:50 offer this 5 rupees worth of sweet
17:51 earlier first you must cure my my son a
17:54 commercial biy commercial
17:57 devotion you give give first and then
18:00 you take give and take there is no
18:03 devotion blind devotion doesn't
18:07 help and this is what happens in the
18:09 name of devotion you always expect
18:11 something this God should do something
18:12 for me that goddess should do something
18:14 for me
18:17 this enlightened person must do
18:19 something for me this saintly person may
18:21 do something for me always expecting
18:23 something expecting something is no no
18:27 purity of the
18:30 someone says that he's a great
18:32 Paka great devote of Rama wonderful to
18:37 be a devote of
18:40 Rama a person of so much good
18:43 qualities you remember those qualities
18:45 and try to EMB those qualities in your
18:48 life it's a wonderful
18:51 bi but one does not do that Rama the
18:56 quality of Rama you might have heard his
18:57 story life story
19:01 he was the eldest
19:03 son and father
19:05 decided because he had given a promise
19:08 to the youngest wife youngest
19:11 queen and the youngest Queen wanted her
19:13 son to become the air to the
19:16 throne so however unwillingly he
19:19 decided that Rama should go in the
19:22 jungle get banished for 14 years and the
19:24 youngest son bat should get the throne
19:29 very willingly he leaves the kingdom
19:32 very very willingly let my younger
19:34 brother enjoy all the luxuries of the
19:37 Royal Palace I'll be quite happy I'll be
19:40 happy happy in Jungle and he goes father
19:43 dies and the younger brother who was not
19:45 present at that time came and when he
19:48 came to know of all this he was shocked
19:51 he's a real ha to the throne not I and
19:54 he goes all the way to the jungle and
19:56 tells him no sir no brother you must go
19:59 back to the capital you are the honor of
20:01 the throne honor of the
20:03 crown in your place I will stay in
20:06 Jungle the father made a wrong decision
20:09 he didn't make the decision in wisdom
20:12 and the elder brother says Rama says oh
20:14 no no this is the order of the father
20:16 you must enjoy all the luxuries of the
20:18 of the royal life two brothers
20:21 throughout the human history you got no
20:23 other example where two brothers are
20:25 fighting quarreling you must enjoy you
20:28 must enjoy all the Royal
20:29 luxury such a wonderful person
20:32 Rama and one says that I'm a devotee of
20:35 Rama two brothers they claim they great
20:38 devotees of Rama and both of them are
20:41 fighting quarreling having civil suits
20:43 and criminal suits or what when our
20:45 property was divided you got a few
20:48 dollars more on here and you got a few
20:51 inches of land more so we are quarreling
20:54 and yet they call they are great
20:55 devotees of Rama Great devotees of Rama
20:59 poor Rama if he's somewhere about the
21:02 crowd clouds he'll be shedding tears
21:05 what kind of devotees I have they don't
21:07 want to take any inspiration from the
21:10 qualities that I have they don't want to
21:12 live a life that I lived and yet they
21:15 call themselves devotees my
21:17 devotees madness such kind of devotion
21:20 does not help does not
21:22 help and then he is taken as God
21:26 almighty
21:28 incarnation of God
21:30 Almighty see what we have made of poor
21:32 God Almighty we devalued him what a
21:35 great
21:37 devaluation somebody writes the name of
21:39 Rama on the forehead Rama on his arms
21:43 Rama on his chest and wears the upper
21:45 cloth printed Rama Rama so that theama
21:49 should know that I such a great devotee
21:51 of
21:51 Rama as if Rama is very fond to hear his
21:54 name every now and then his name his
21:57 name people should keep on reciting his
21:59 name if he's the creator of the world he
22:03 should have created people only reciting
22:06 nothing else because he so fond of these
22:08 words if he's really fond of only his
22:10 name then what ego centered person he is
22:14 what a self centered
22:16 person it is said
22:18 that God
22:20 created human
22:22 beings in his own
22:24 image but I feel
22:26 otherwise human beings created God in
22:29 their own image according to their own
22:32 liking we want such a God and we keep on
22:37 reciting his name he gets puffed up then
22:39 whatever we do right or wrong we will
22:42 get all the benefits and he will give us
22:44 this benefit or that benefit this kind
22:46 of God we
22:48 create our own imagination our own
22:52 creation for example if there is a Goa M
22:55 Goa who is very fond of his name
22:59 every day people should talk about going
23:02 going on the radio going going on the TV
23:05 going going on the newspaper goaa and
23:08 people build temples of Goa and
23:11 establish statues of Goa and then start
23:13 dancing
23:16 goaa and this Goa gets puffed up
23:20 wonderful such a mad
23:22 Goa when he creates a imaginary God he
23:25 will create a god of that type who will
23:27 gets puffed up by hearing his name what
23:31 we have done poor God if he exists poor
23:35 God we have so much devalued him this
23:39 this is what happens when the devotion
23:40 becomes blind devotion you forget to get
23:44 inspiration from the qualities and you
23:46 forget to inspire with this inspiration
23:48 to develop those qualities in you then
23:51 devotion is
23:53 harmful someone says I'm a great devotee
23:55 of Jesus Christ oh wonderful such a
23:59 saintly
24:00 person a prince among the saints so
24:04 saintly whether someone is really
24:06 saintly or
24:08 not the yard stick is at the time of
24:11 death what kind of mind this person is
24:14 carrying and what kind of mind he was
24:17 carrying he was tortured to death
24:22 crucified being tortured he is not a
24:25 trace of anger or aversion or hatred to
24:28 are those people who are torturing him
24:31 only love only
24:33 compassion they don't know what they are
24:36 doing ignorant people may they not be
24:39 punished for their bad Deeds they are so
24:42 ignorant only love only compassion a
24:45 real saintly person if someone say that
24:48 I a devotee of Jesus Christ and does not
24:51 develop even little bit of love and
24:53 compassion and good willll for others
24:55 then this devotion is blind devotion
24:58 someone comes to me and says that I am a
25:00 devotee of Jesus Christ because I accept
25:04 that he was son of the god so what he
25:07 was son of the
25:09 God as if he wants a testimonial from
25:13 you and then he'll be very happy well
25:16 look these people they give me so many
25:18 people give me testimony I am son of the
25:20 god and what sort of Christ is
25:23 Christ we are mad what we are
25:26 doing is there any doubt that he was son
25:28 of the God he was son of the god after
25:31 all what is God truth is God love is God
25:35 compassion is God Purity is God and here
25:38 is a product of truth of Love of
25:41 compassion of good willll of Purity he's
25:44 a product of that he's Son of God those
25:47 qualities are important and if we try to
25:50 develop those very qualities in us then
25:52 yes we are good devotees of Jesus Christ
25:55 otherwise no it becomes a blind faith
25:57 blind devotion does not work does not
26:01 work someone says I'm a devote of Buddha
26:05 how wonderful to be a devote of Buddha
26:07 have devotion towards Buddha fully
26:10 enlightened person liberated person but
26:13 again if the devotion becomes blind
26:15 devotion then early morning somebody
26:18 with folded hands will
26:20 say take ref buha take refug and Buddha
26:23 take refug and Buddha three times I've
26:26 taken refug and Buddha now free for the
26:28 whole day to do whatever I like I get
26:31 open General license for doing anything
26:34 after all why I took refuge in Buddha so
26:37 that he can liberate Me In Spite all my
26:39 bad Deeds he should liberate me
26:41 otherwise why you take refuge in Buddha
26:43 Madness not understood what does he mean
26:47 what does he mean when he ask people to
26:48 take refuge in Buddha quality
26:51 Enlightenment take refuge and
26:53 Enlightenment and take refuge and
26:55 Enlightenment means develop
26:57 Enlightenment in you
26:58 your own Enlightenment is going to give
27:01 you Refuge no one else will give you
27:04 protection no one else you to take
27:06 refuge in your Enlightenment develop
27:08 that quality and then
27:10 yes there is a purpose in saying that I
27:13 take refuge in Buddha otherwise it
27:15 becomes a blind devotion blind
27:20 devotion he's not
27:22 interested to establish a sect he
27:25 doesn't want more and more people to say
27:27 I take refuge and Buddha and have a
27:29 bigger sect nothing doing he interested
27:33 full of compassion to see people that
27:35 they come out of their misery they
27:37 belong to this sect or that sect makes
27:39 no difference people of this community
27:42 or that Community makes no difference of
27:43 this country or that country makes no
27:45 difference this gender or that gender
27:47 makes no difference suffering is there
27:50 an Enlightenment of Buddha
27:52 is he gives a path because of his
27:55 Enlightenment he found out the path
27:57 which made him enlightened and out of
27:59 all the compassion he gives that path if
28:02 you don't walk on the path the devotion
28:04 is no devotion it doesn't
28:09 work when we give respect to Buddha he
28:12 teaches us how to pay respect to
28:16 Buddha Buddha is not a name of any
28:19 person is the quality enlightened one
28:23 and anyone can be enlightened person not
28:25 merely go this is not the Monopoly of of
28:28 one person to become enlightened he kept
28:30 on saying that before me there were
28:32 countless Buddhas and after me there
28:35 will be countless Buddhas so when you
28:38 pay respect to Buddha he taught us how
28:41 to pay respect to
28:52 Buddha all the Buddhas of the past
28:55 a all the Buddhas of the
29:03 future all the Buddhas who are now
29:06 present
29:11 maybe I pay respect to all the budas of
29:15 the past of the future of the
29:18 present then you not get entangled
29:21 yourself in a sect in an organized
29:24 religion then you get
29:27 inspiration from the enlightenment the
29:29 quality of Enlightenment and try to
29:31 develop that Enlightenment in
29:33 you whenever you pay homage to
29:37 Buddha he explained us how to pay hom to
29:51 Buddha I pay homies to anyone who has
29:54 these qualities
29:58 s SAS who is fully liberated fully
30:02 enlightened and enlightened by his own
30:04 efforts to such a person I pay home
30:08 age you pay
30:10 respect we say you do
30:15 Puja there is a Puja which is called
30:18 samish Puja impure Puja you have image
30:22 of Buddha and you offer incense and
30:25 flowers and sweets and bow down and you
30:27 s doing pu of
30:29 Buddha
30:32 noish and what is Nish Puja pure Puja
30:36 and he
30:43 says I do the Puja of Buddha that means
30:46 I pay respect to Buddha by walking on
30:48 the path of DH from the grossest to the
30:52 subtlest you start with Sila the
30:54 grossest part of dhama then you proceed
30:57 to samadi
30:58 subtler than that you proceed to PA
31:00 subtler than that and you transcend that
31:03 also and experience nib this subtlest
31:06 Ultimate Reality this is how you pay
31:08 respect to
31:13 budha the teaching the D must be very
31:16 well understood the having respect for
31:19 somebody having devotion towards
31:22 somebody should not make it one should
31:24 not make it a blind devotion otherwise
31:27 it does not work
31:30 similarly having respect for Buddha one
31:33 must keep on remembering the quality of
31:35 Buddha what are the qualities of budha
31:38 and these are the qualities of Buddha
32:06 he is a
32:08 bhagan what bhagan in 25th centuries
32:12 India has lost the meaning of this word
32:14 bhagan now there are bhag like Monson
32:18 frogs here and there everywhere ban
32:20 everybody claims i a bhagan what bhagan
32:24 25 centuries back what was bhagan BH
32:34 one who has destroyed all the Raa
32:36 craving all the abortion DHA and all the
32:39 ignorance illusion delusion
32:42 MOA lives lives in the glory of
32:45 Liberation is a
32:47 bhagwa so unless all these impurities
32:50 are ricated to call once bhaga is wrong
32:54 and Buddha is a bhagwa a bhagan you get
32:57 ins inspiration to develop those
32:59 qualities little by little you are
33:00 coming out of Raa you coming out of do
33:03 you're coming out of MOA craving
33:05 abortion ignorance then you are real
33:07 really paying respect to Buddha you go
33:10 devotion towards Buddha
33:13 AR again old language of India Ari means
33:20 enemies H when was killed killed all the
33:24 enemies oh an opposal of nonviolence how
33:27 can I kill anybody
33:28 and yet he has killed all his enemies
33:30 and who are our enemies no Outsider no
33:33 Outsider being is our enemy our own
33:35 impurities are our enemies one who has
33:38 killed all the impurities not a trace of
33:40 defilement in the mind has become an
33:42 arhan has killed all the enemy s s he
33:48 has become fully enlightened by his own
33:50 efforts every one has to become fully
33:53 enlightened by one's own efforts one
33:55 does not make effort and expect some
33:57 super natural power some invisible power
33:59 to make you enlightened has not
34:01 understood what Buddha is s SD each has
34:05 to work out one's own salvation get
34:08 one's own Enlightenment Enlightenment by
34:10 one's own
34:12 efforts
34:20 it is perfect in VI and perfect in aan
34:25 that means in practice as well as the
34:26 theory one understand Dharma at the
34:29 highest level VI the wisdom and then
34:32 applies it in the life this is the
34:34 quality of
34:39 Buddha whatever he speaks he practices
34:42 in life whatever he practices that much
34:44 only speaks nothing more than that and
34:46 that is why he's called t one who has
34:49 walked on the path of personal
34:51 experience of the truth truth truth has
34:54 reached the ultimate goal of ultimate
34:55 truth if we say that we are devotees of
34:58 Buddha we have to follow that step by
35:01 step with the truth with the
35:05 truth every step taken by this person is
35:09 Right Step at the physical level or
35:11 vocal level or mental level he can't do
35:13 anything that will harm others we also
35:15 try to develop that quality in us every
35:18 step of ours every action of ours should
35:20 go for the good of others not to harm
35:23 others
35:25 Lo when he has realized the truth of the
35:27 entire universe within the framework of
35:30 the body we also start taking steps to
35:33 experience the truth of the entire
35:35 universe within the framework of the
35:39 body whole life one who keeps on serving
35:42 people serving people so much of
35:46 compassion he becomes enlightened at the
35:48 age of
35:49 35 and passes away at the age of 80 45
35:53 years day and night serving people
35:55 serving people suffering all around
35:57 people people are so
35:58 miserable he finds out a wonderful
36:01 technique wonderful path and out of
36:04 compassion he keeps on serving keeps on
36:06 serving day and night hardly 2 to 3
36:09 hours he will sleep and that also just
36:11 lying down with the awareness and with
36:13 wisdom rest of the time serving serving
36:16 serving whole life kept on serving
36:20 people now it is 80th
36:23 year and 3 month before he passes away
36:28 he announces that after 3 months I will
36:31 leave this
36:32 body where I should leave at that time
36:35 he was in the eastern part of India
36:37 somewhere and he decides to go to
36:39 kushinagar a big city in the middle of
36:42 the northern part of
36:43 India and he has reached there now this
36:47 full moon night at the end of this full
36:49 moon night he will breathe his last he's
36:53 lying under a tree his attendant Ananda
36:56 is there to serve him
36:58 and suddenly a thought comes in the mind
37:01 of
37:01 Ananda tomorrow morning as the day
37:04 breaks he will be no more and he has got
37:08 thousands of people in this city who are
37:11 his devotees when they will come to know
37:13 that he came so close to our city this
37:16 mad fellow Ananda didn't inform us
37:18 otherwise at least we would have seen
37:20 him paid respect while he was alive so
37:22 it is my duty I must inform he went to
37:25 the city just informed one or two and
37:27 and then the word spread like a wild
37:29 fire everywhere people started coming in
37:31 large number tomorrow morning he will
37:33 not be there so we must pay respect
37:35 while is alive large number of people
37:37 coming Anand doesn't know how to manage
37:41 them he request them please come in a
37:43 queue that more and more people PE
37:45 respect and go PE respect and go first
37:48 part of the night over middle part of
37:49 the night over now the last part of the
37:52 night is getting over in a few minutes
37:54 he will breathe his last still there is
37:56 such a big Gathering
37:58 somebody at the head of the queue he
38:00 doesn't move he says
38:02 no you want me just to go and pay
38:04 respect to him that body what I will
38:07 gain I want to go to him to learn this
38:10 wonderful technique from him I know he's
38:13 fully enlightened he knows the technique
38:15 I don't know what you people will will
38:16 teach after he passes away you may teach
38:19 properly or not teach properly while
38:20 he's alive I want to learn the technique
38:23 Anand says well look in a few minutes
38:26 he's going to breathe his last this is
38:27 not a time to teach you
38:29 D and he says no so all right if you
38:32 don't want to pay
38:34 respect leave the space for others let
38:36 them come and he neither moves nor goes
38:38 himself and these words reaches the ears
38:42 of
38:43 Buddha somebody has come to the genes to
38:47 take a handful of water to quench The
38:50 Thirst and people tell him no you can't
38:52 quench your thirst you can't take water
38:54 just pay respect to genjis and go away
38:57 GES starts overflowing the GES of
39:01 compassion starts overflowing Anand
39:03 allow him to come he needs dama he's a
39:06 proper person to be given dama he needs
39:09 it send him I will teach dama while
39:12 breathing is last it teaches D at least
39:14 one person should
39:15 get not a single moment should go waste
39:18 just serving people serving people
39:20 without caring anything about his own
39:22 discomfort helping people helping if we
39:25 develop even little bit of such
39:27 compassion such love such Goodwill such
39:31 selfless service then there is a meaning
39:34 in saying that we are devotees of Buddha
39:36 otherwise it is just no purpose is
39:41 served someone
39:44 says that I take take refuge in D I got
39:48 great
39:49 devotion towards T the teaching of
39:53 Buddha what
39:54 D unless one understands what d
39:58 and simply says I take refuge in D
39:59 doesn't work take refuge in DH you live
40:03 the life of dama you develop dma in you
40:05 you develop Shea samadi PA in you then
40:08 there is purpose of your saying that I
40:10 take refuge in dhma otherwise it is
40:12 purposeless it is
40:14 senseless and what dhma is dhma is not a
40:18 sect dhma is not a organized religion
40:22 dhma is universal law law of nature if
40:25 one has started Living the Life in line
40:27 to the law of nature then yes one has
40:30 taken refuge in
40:34 DH and he explains what are the
40:36 qualities of DH six qualities of DH one
40:39 has to keep on understanding whether
40:41 those qualities are there or not
40:43 otherwise in the name of dhma one may
40:45 get unentangled in some kind of sect
40:47 belief Dogma Etc what are the qualities
40:50 of pure
40:59 it must be very clearly
41:02 explained no mysticism
41:05 involved no acrobatic intellectual
41:08 exercises nothing doing so simple in so
41:11 simple words it must be explained so
41:14 that ordinary person can understand it
41:16 because one has to follow it unless
41:18 people understand this is not the game
41:20 of philosophers or Scholars this is
41:23 something which people should understand
41:25 and follow that is why the First Quality
41:34 then whatever you are experiencing with
41:37 your direct experience the truth that
41:39 you experience then it is D the truth
41:42 experienced by an enlightened person is
41:44 not Truth for you the truth as explained
41:47 in the scriptures is no Truth for you
41:49 the truth experienced by your teacher is
41:51 no Truth for you what you
41:54 experience with your own eyes with your
41:56 own experience direct experience step by
41:59 step step by step you may start with
42:01 very gross truth doesn't matter this is
42:04 your truth your own experience your own
42:07 wisdom and you keep on walking on the
42:08 path with the truth with the truth you
42:10 are bound to experience subtler subtler
42:13 subtler the entire field of mind and
42:15 matter you experience the truth of mind
42:17 and matter and then transcend and
42:19 experience something which is beyond
42:21 mind and matter
42:30 aik to get the fruits of your practice
42:33 of dhma should not take
42:35 time not that you practice dhma now and
42:38 you will get benefit after death you
42:40 perform this R this ritual this ceremony
42:43 and after that you will get this seventh
42:45 heaven or 11th Heaven who has come from
42:47 sth Heaven to tell me that I have
42:49 performed these rights and that's why I
42:50 I'm in this seventh heaven all
42:52 purposeless what you gain now of course
42:54 after death also you will get benefit
42:56 but what benefit you are getting now if
42:59 you're getting no benefit now then it is
43:01 no D you taken steps on D you must get
43:05 benefit of you having taken steps on D
43:07 then only it is pure D otherwise no D
43:11 somebody gives me a post-d
43:14 check post did a check on a bank above
43:17 the clouds which does not exist what am
43:20 I to do with this posted check one must
43:23 get
43:24 benefit there should not be a gap
43:27 between my action and my my the fruit
43:30 that I
43:32 get a change must start in the life if
43:35 you really started taking steps on the
43:37 path a change must start here and now in
43:40 this very life a change for
43:44 better another very important quality of
43:47 T if someone has really started taking
43:51 steps on dhma one has to judge examine
43:54 whether really it is dhma or not a
43:58 which literal meaning is come come and
44:01 see yourself come and examine yourself
44:04 come and experience
44:07 yourself people come to courses like
44:09 this some on the fourth day some on the
44:12 fifth day some on the six day they start
44:15 thinking oh it is so wonderful my mother
44:17 should do it my father should do it so
44:21 who should do it and suddenly you
44:22 realize I'm here to observe my
44:23 respiration my sensation I will I will I
44:26 will see about that later on and again
44:28 after some time you start thinking oh so
44:30 and so very miserable person this person
44:32 must certainly get it this is AO this is
44:36 the quality of D because you're not
44:38 playing a intellectual game you're not
44:41 playing a devotional or emotional game
44:43 you are actually experiencing
44:46 something those who come to courses and
44:48 say the discourses your
44:51 wonderful what discourse is wonderful
44:53 the dama was wonderful if you just make
44:55 it intellectual entertainment then no it
44:57 doesn't work because people come here
44:59 and meditate because they meditate they
45:02 can't resist when 10 days are over one
45:06 starts thinking whomever one meets oh it
45:09 is so wonderful I have tasted it is so
45:11 good it has helped me you also go and
45:13 try you also go and try this is the yard
45:16 stick to measure whether one is
45:18 certainly surely tasted dma or not if
45:22 one has really tasted dhma one is bound
45:25 to get some benefit and and when one
45:27 gets benefit one feels like sharing this
45:30 benefit with others if someone is a good
45:32 writer he feels like writing something
45:34 so that more and more people know about
45:36 it people do not know that such a such a
45:39 technique is prevailing is being taught
45:41 if one is auditor he will keep on talk
45:43 go talking here and
45:45 there if one is comfortable MoneyWise
45:49 will try to spend more and more money so
45:51 that more and more people come and get
45:53 advantage of
45:54 it not that you want to enlarg in your
45:58 sect now the small sect Let There Be
46:00 vasna sect a bigger vashna sect no
46:03 nothing doing more and more people are
46:05 miserable if they come in contact with
46:06 dama if they come in contact with this
46:08 technique they will come out of their
46:10 misery This Love This
46:12 compassion and then someone
46:14 feels well when I went to a
46:17 course all the facilities were given to
46:19 me because somebody has donated not only
46:22 that so many people selflessly were
46:25 serving me that's why I could meditate
46:27 so peacefully so
46:29 comfortably oh I must also give 10 days
46:32 of my life I must go and serve in one of
46:35 the courses and people come like this to
46:38 give their
46:39 service more and more people can get
46:41 benefit of
46:42 it it is good when somebody gives a a
46:46 donation because more people can get
46:48 advantage of the
46:50 facility but it is much better if
46:52 somebody gives a donation of service you
46:55 see it is the volution that counts
46:57 when you are giving money you are giving
46:59 money for the liberation of people to
47:02 come out of their
47:04 misery you give money to feed
47:08 somebody you give money to get water for
47:12 somebody or some medicine for somebody
47:13 they are all good but when you give
47:15 money for the teaching of D nothing like
47:19 that you is that people come out of
47:22 their misery total
47:24 misery when you serve
47:27 when you give money that moment when you
47:30 thought of you decided to donate money
47:33 was a good moment your volution was
47:35 wonderful when you actually gave money
47:38 your tion was wonderful but when you
47:40 serve for 10 days for 10 days
47:43 continuously you are serving you are
47:44 serving you are serving and every time
47:46 you are there you feel good of others ah
47:49 look so many people get D look so many
47:51 people are coming out of their misery
47:53 continuously for 10 days you are
47:55 developing this part Army you are
47:57 developing this volution D volution it
48:01 is wonderful people who have been giving
48:04 such service they find it with my own
48:07 experience I know how I found it when
48:10 one starts giving service one's own
48:12 meditation becomes stronger and stronger
48:15 when you give food to somebody the
48:17 nature helps you that you will not stve
48:21 similarly when you give dhma to somebody
48:23 your dhma in return will become stronger
48:25 and stronger you get more dma so like
48:28 this people think ofu more and more I
48:31 serve more and more people so that more
48:33 and more people get dhma more and more
48:34 people get dma this is the quality the
48:37 yard stick whether one is really practic
48:40 dma or
48:44 not if it is pure D then every step that
48:47 you take on the path takes you nearer
48:50 and nearer to the final goal because the
48:53 path is such so clear
48:57 like a highway autoban no curves here
49:01 and there not that you enter blindly and
49:03 then come back nothing doing every step
49:05 takes you to the final goal and that
49:15 is it is beneficial in the beginning
49:17 beneficial in the middle beneficial in
49:19 the end you practice only sha and you
49:21 find you start getting benefits you
49:23 practice samadi more benefits you
49:25 practice PA much more benefits you reach
49:27 the final goal countless benefits you
49:30 get every step every step that you take
49:33 on the path gives result good result not
49:37 a single step not a little effort that
49:39 you make on the path of dhama goes waste
49:41 nothing goes waste and in this way it is
49:51 called direct experience by everyone
49:54 when we belong to this sect or that sect
49:56 this or that Community makes no
49:58 difference dhma is for all everyone can
50:01 get benefit of dhma by practicing
50:03 oneself it is not that first you get
50:05 converted in this particular organized
50:08 religion then this particular organized
50:10 religion will start helping you nothing
50:12 doing then there is something wrong
50:15 anybody when may keep on calling oneself
50:17 a Hindu a Hindu a Christian a Christian
50:19 a Jew a Jew a Muslim a Muslim a Buddhist
50:22 a Buddhist makes no difference human
50:24 being is human being out of ignorance
50:26 when keep keeps on generating craving
50:28 abortion ignorance and because of that
50:30 one remains so very much agitated so
50:32 very much miserable the path is there to
50:35 take out the Misery by taking out the
50:37 impurities of the mind so anyone can
50:39 practice and we'll get the same
50:43 result it must be direct experience if
50:47 you play intellectual game it doesn't
50:49 work the same teaching was there the
50:52 entire spectrum of the spirituality of
50:55 India before Buddha at the the time of
50:57 Buddha and after Buddha Remains the Same
50:59 come out of craving come out of Aion
51:02 come out of Illusion delusion nothing
51:05 new nothing new but still so much new
51:08 because that is all at the intellectual
51:10 level at the emotional level here arose
51:13 somebody who says at the actual level
51:16 how to come out of craving well look You
51:18 observe your sensation you are craving
51:20 starts because of a pleasant sensation
51:23 come out of a verion look at your
51:25 sensation observe it Whenever there is
51:27 unpleasant sensation then only you start
51:29 ation really at the Practical level
51:32 somebody is teaching and this is
51:35 p at the level of V one has to
51:38 understand the reality and come out of
51:40 the
51:42 misery any wise person can do this can
51:45 practice this it is applicable to one
51:48 and all these are the qualities of dama
51:51 understanding these qualities if one
51:52 starts walking on the path the benefit
51:54 is bound to be there
51:57 similarly one says I take refuge in s
52:00 not in any person the quality of the
52:02 person anybody who's walking on the
52:04 right
52:20 path anyone who is parking on the right
52:23 path the correct path the path of Truth
52:25 the path of wisdom
52:27 and walking on the path walking on the
52:29 path one has reached the stage where one
52:31 has become a saintly person four stages
52:34 of Liberation out of them at least first
52:37 stage one has
52:38 reached and then only one is called a
52:41 real s such a person by seeing such a
52:44 saintly person one gets inspiration and
52:47 with this inspiration one starts walking
52:48 on the path this is taking refuge and S
52:52 the devotion is good devotion with the
52:56 wisdom when one
52:58 starts applying dhma in life one starts
53:02 developing the qualities in life this is
53:04 sadha the first important friend of
53:08 ours second important friend in the
53:11 language of those days it was called vi
53:14 vi means affort again proper effort if
53:18 you don't know how to make effort you
53:20 make effort in the wrong way and yet you
53:22 don't get the result proper effort what
53:24 you to do
53:26 there a story back in our country in
53:30 India in the city of
53:33 Varanasi a very ancient holy city of
53:36 Northern India four
53:40 friends one moonlit night they decided
53:43 we better have boting for the whole
53:44 night and they took a
53:47 boat and waran is wari it is a city of
53:51 hashish
53:53 bang lot of smoking of bang and eat
53:56 drinking of bang and they had all that
53:59 and then in that boat they started
54:01 rowing rowing the whole night rowing
54:04 perspiring rowing perspiring day break
54:08 and they show their boat has not moved
54:09 even an inch it is where it was it was
54:12 wrong and then someone found out the
54:16 Rope by which this boat was tied to the
54:19 to the tree at the bank nobody untied
54:22 this rope this rope of ignorance is
54:24 there and you keep on rowing growing
54:27 perspiring perspiring what you will get
54:30 you must know how to work and then you
54:33 work properly with wisdom understanding
54:35 what the path is understanding what the
54:37 technique is yes you will reach the
54:39 final goal otherwise all your efforts
54:41 will go
54:42 waste weor and third important friend is
54:46 Sati awareness
54:49 awareness now Sati has got two meanings
54:51 this word one meaning of the word Sati
54:55 smti is memory people take that meaning
54:58 sometimes memory and you start
55:00 remembering memory of the past is not
55:03 the technique of Liberation Sati the
55:06 another meaning of sa is awareness and
55:08 awareness is always of the present
55:11 moment you can't be aware of the past
55:13 you can have memory of that you can't be
55:15 aware of the future you can just be
55:17 thinking of that but you can't be aware
55:20 of it awareness should always be and can
55:22 always be for the present moment from
55:24 moment to moment what whatever you
55:26 experience you are aware of it whatever
55:28 you experience you are aware of it aware
55:30 of the surface level and aware of the
55:33 depth level when you work with the
55:35 sensation you are aware at the depth
55:37 level and as well as where you are
55:39 walking you are aware of walking you are
55:41 aware of eating but at the same time
55:43 you're aware of your own Sensations if
55:45 that is missing then it won't take you
55:48 to final goal you may be very well aware
55:50 of your walking walking walking you get
55:52 a wonderful faculty to remain alert
55:55 about all your activities
55:56 but it won't take you to the final goal
55:58 of Liberation if you are missing
56:01 sensation I give example of a circus
56:05 girl she is walking on a tight robe and
56:08 so much aware of every step if she's not
56:11 aware she may fall down break one of her
56:13 limbs or she may even die so every step
56:15 she is so aware so aware but she cannot
56:18 become an nand she cannot become fully
56:20 liberated because the sensation she
56:22 doesn't know what sensation is and she
56:24 doesn't know how to remain equanimous
56:26 with the
56:26 sensation or a dancing girl on the stage
56:29 aware of every step every action and yet
56:33 no Sensation that doesn't take us to the
56:35 final goal sensation is the teaching of
56:38 Buddha when you work with the sensation
56:40 you are aware of the sensation you
56:42 understand its nature of anicha and with
56:44 that understanding you maintain
56:46 Equanimity then you are on the path of
56:48 Liberation because this is how you
56:50 change the Habit pattern of your mind at
56:52 the deepest level otherwise you are
56:54 working just with the surface level of
56:55 the Mind so Sati must be proper Sati
56:58 with proper wisdom understanding what
57:01 the Sati is and then accordingly you
57:03 work with Sati you reach the final goal
57:05 and then samadi again samadi must be
57:09 Sama samadi right type of samadi
57:12 understanding must be proper what samadi
57:13 is mere concentration does not
57:18 work the concentration must be of a pure
57:21 mind that means the base must be free
57:23 from
57:24 ignorance if you you got imaginary
57:27 object and with the help of this
57:28 imaginary object you concentrate your
57:30 mind it is not s samadi or at the base
57:33 of the mind you got craving you want
57:35 something by this sadii I'll gain this
57:37 I'll gain that doesn't work or your
57:39 abortion at the base doesn't work free
57:42 from craving free from abortion free
57:44 from imagination the object that you are
57:47 experiencing from moment to moment you
57:49 are sa from moment to moment from moment
57:51 to moment how long you continue to be
57:53 aware of the reality from moment to
57:55 moment from moment to moment this is
57:57 your real
57:59 sadii and the fourth fifth friend PA
58:03 wisdom
58:06 Equanimity very important again if this
58:09 PA this wisdom is merely at the
58:11 intellectual level or merely whatever
58:14 you heard or whatever you read suay or
58:17 chint may it doesn't work it must
58:22 be that is the contribution of Buddha to
58:25 the human World B may you to experience
58:29 the wisdom at the level of your
58:31 Sensations then it is real P Equanimity
58:35 at the level of Sensations is your
58:37 direct experience and Equanimity wisdom
58:41 that keeps you free from craving free
58:43 from abortion at the deepest level of
58:45 the
58:46 mind this is what you started doing here
58:49 this is what you to practice in your
58:51 life daily practice you are with the
58:53 sensations and that you are not reacting
58:55 with craving you're not reacting with a
58:56 version you keep on understanding this
58:58 is anicha anicha and your mind becomes
59:00 equanimous then you find how this
59:02 Equanimity has started manifesting
59:05 itself in your day-to-day life it must
59:08 manifest if you have just accepted an if
59:11 you have just accepted Equanimity only
59:13 at the intellectual level or devotional
59:15 level you can't expect it to manifest in
59:18 your day-to-day life ups and downs in
59:20 the Life are bound to be there visites
59:23 are bound to be there how to deal with
59:25 equanimity to all the situations in our
59:28 day-to-day life then yes the PA is real
59:31 PA again a story in our
59:34 country a very rich person at the old
59:37 age
59:38 died and according to the custom there
59:43 his two sons started Living in a joint
59:45 family for some time they continued in
59:48 joint family and later on some
59:49 misunderstanding arose they started
59:51 quarreling and then they divided the
59:53 whole property the money jewelry land
59:56 everything divided half half when
59:58 everything was divided somebody found
1:00:00 out a small packet hidden somewhere they
1:00:03 took it out what it is and they found
1:00:05 that it contained two rings one was the
1:00:07 ordinary silver ring other was a ring
1:00:11 studied with very valuable
1:00:13 Diamond the elder brother developed some
1:00:17 greed and he tried to explain the
1:00:19 younger one to me it looks this is not
1:00:22 the earning of our father this is most
1:00:26 probably it is coming from generations
1:00:28 and therefore it it should go for
1:00:30 Generations I being Elder I better keep
1:00:32 it so that it goes for Generation if you
1:00:35 sell it and divide the money you will
1:00:37 lose it so I better keep it you better
1:00:39 keep the silver one the younger brother
1:00:42 smiled all right be happy you be happy
1:00:45 with the diamond one I'll be happy with
1:00:47 the silver one and they started their
1:00:49 life ups and downs ups and downs are
1:00:52 coming the elder brother with a diamond
1:00:54 ring
1:00:56 when there is spring in the life they
1:00:58 get so elated so elated and when spring
1:01:02 goes away and there is winter or Autumn
1:01:05 he becomes so depressed so depressed
1:01:08 always losing the balance of the mind
1:01:10 with everything he faces in the world
1:01:12 loses the balance of the Mind loses the
1:01:14 balance of the Mind tension tension
1:01:17 hypertension this tranquilizer that
1:01:20 tranquilizer a super
1:01:22 tranquilizer a sleeping pill a super
1:01:24 sleeping pill and then it came to the
1:01:27 stage where electric shocks were given
1:01:29 this is the brother with the diamond
1:01:31 ring the other brother with ordinary
1:01:33 silver ring he started thinking my
1:01:36 father kept very secure this valuable
1:01:39 diamond ring it is understandable why
1:01:41 this ordinary silver ring there must be
1:01:43 some meaning some purpose for that and
1:01:46 he started examining it and he found
1:01:48 something was inscribed on it and he
1:01:50 read what is inscribed and it was
1:01:52 inscribed on it this will also change
1:01:55 change oh this will also change this is
1:01:59 the teaching of my father this will also
1:02:02 change everything changes and he had
1:02:05 this ring on his little finger spring
1:02:07 comes he enjoys it doesn't run away from
1:02:09 that he enjoys spring and looking at the
1:02:12 finger yes this will also change this is
1:02:15 not Eternal and when it passes away he
1:02:17 smiles I knew this was going to change
1:02:18 it has changed so what I don't care he
1:02:21 doesn't lose the balance of the mind
1:02:23 when winter comes again his ring this
1:02:25 will also change it doesn't cry it
1:02:27 doesn't feel depressed this will also
1:02:29 change law of nature is such it has to
1:02:31 change ups and downs ups and downs are
1:02:34 bound to come in the Life visites are
1:02:36 bound to come in the life if you keep on
1:02:38 understanding this will also change this
