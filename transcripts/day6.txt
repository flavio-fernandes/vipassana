0:00 The sixth day is over.
0:14 You have now four more left to work and work very seriously, very diligently, very patiently
0:27 and persistently to get best results of your stay here.
0:36 Sixth day is a very important day.
0:41 I am glad you have crossed this hurdle, sixth day, as I said the second day and the sixth
0:48 day.
0:51 It is difficult for a weak-minded person to cross the hurdle.
0:57 On the first day, even when you start, operation starts and with this operation, the second
1:05 day one feels like running away.
1:08 Then again after Vipassana, the fifth day, sixth day, operation goes deeper and one feels
1:14 like running away under some pretext or the other.
1:22 One pretext.
1:24 On the fifth day evening, the discourse says so much about Dukkha, misery, misery.
1:30 The birth starts with misery and then the whole life misery, misery of disease, misery
1:37 of old age, misery of dying, misery of things happening which you don't like, misery of
1:43 things not happening that you like, misery, misery, life after life misery.
1:48 Oh, this path is path of misery.
1:53 One doesn't want to understand.
1:55 This is a very pessimistic teaching.
1:58 No, I must run.
2:02 Doesn't try to understand or finds an excuse to run away.
2:06 There is no pessimism, not a trace of pessimism in the teaching.
2:12 If the teaching said that you have to suffer, there is misery, there is no way out, then
2:17 yes pessimism, but the teaching says there is a way out.
2:21 You can come out of all your miseries and you can reach the stage where you are totally
2:27 free from misery, enjoy real peace, real harmony, full of optimism, full of optimism.
2:39 Back home in India there is a story, story in our country.
2:45 A mother sends the young son to the grocery shop nearby, gives one empty bottle, one ten
2:55 rupee currency note, go, go and buy some cooking oil.
3:00 The boy goes, purchases oil, the bottle is filled with oil.
3:07 On his way back, out of carelessness, he gets knocked down, the bottle falls.
3:16 Half of the oil flows out.
3:18 He picks up the bottle, half empty, crying, crying, he comes to the mother, oh mother
3:25 I lost half the oil, I lost half the oil.
3:30 Very pessimistic, very pessimistic.
3:34 Story is story.
3:36 Mother sends another son, another ten rupee note, another bottle.
3:42 He also buys oil, gets the bottle filled and story is story, he also falls down.
3:48 The bottle falls down.
3:50 Half the oil has flowed out.
3:54 This boy picks up the bottle, very happy, smiling and goes to the mother, look I saved
3:59 half the oil, I saved half the oil.
4:02 I fell down, the bottle fell down, the bottle would have broken, all the oil would have
4:06 gone away, look half the oil is saved.
4:10 Both have reached in the same situation, half bottle full, half empty.
4:14 One is crying for the empty one, very pessimistic.
4:18 Other is happy with the filled one, at least half is full, very happy, optimistic.
4:25 Story is story.
4:27 Mother sends the third son.
4:30 Story is story, he also falls down, half the oil is out, he picks up the bottle, like the
4:36 second boy, he comes smiling, I saved half the bottle, I saved half oil.
4:42 But this boy is a Vipassana boy.
4:45 Not only optimistic, he is realistic also.
4:48 I have lost half the oil, this is truth, my bottle is half empty.
4:53 And not only realistic, he is a workist, like Vipassana, now I must work.
4:59 He says, I go out and work hard and by this evening I will earn five rupees and get this
5:05 bottle filled.
5:07 So, Dhamma is not merely optimism, it is also realism, it is also workism.
5:14 So, each individual has to work, always remaining optimistic.
5:18 Now pessimism, not a trace of pessimism in Dhamma, all optimism, optimism.
5:25 You got a path now to come out of misery.
5:27 The way is there, you have to accept it.
5:31 Half bottle is empty, you have to accept it.
5:33 How to fill it?
5:35 The misery is there.
5:36 Accept that misery.
5:37 And the way is there to come out of misery, make use of that.
5:42 This is what you started doing.
5:46 You are realizing the truth.
5:48 It is not merely an intellectual exercise, not an emotional or devotional acceptance
5:53 of the truth of misery and the way out of misery.
5:57 You are experiencing.
5:59 When you are working with the sensation, you are living.
6:04 Living wisdom is there.
6:06 The truth is there, which you are experiencing.
6:10 It is not the wisdom of somebody else, not a borrowed wisdom, your own wisdom with direct
6:16 experience.
6:19 The whole process of observing the sensation makes you understand because you started giving
6:28 importance to the truth within the framework of the body and the truth at the experiential
6:33 level.
6:34 Otherwise, whole life, all importance was given to object outside, object outside.
6:43 You are craving, even though you know you are craving.
6:48 But you are craving for object outside.
6:50 And that object has become so predominant for you, it keeps on overpowering you.
6:55 You forget that you are craving.
6:57 And you also forget that by craving you have lost the balance of your mind.
7:02 And you become very miserable.
7:07 And you also don't understand that you have become an addict to this craving.
7:14 In natural requirement, you are thirsty, you want water, nothing wrong.
7:19 You work hard to get water, when you are thirsty.
7:22 You tried, you didn't get water, you smiled, all right, I try again.
7:26 You didn't get, I try again.
7:28 You don't lose the balance of your mind.
7:31 But when you start craving water, oh still not water, what will happen to me, I may die,
7:36 water, water, you lost the balance of your mind, you become so miserable.
7:41 Water is not observing all that inside.
7:46 Water is not that important, you are craving.
7:49 Even craving is not that important.
7:52 Craving brings misery.
7:53 The moment you start craving something, that means you are wanting something which is not
7:59 there.
8:01 You are not contented, you are not satisfied with whatever is.
8:06 You want something which is not, which is not is which is not.
8:11 And you become very miserable because of that.
8:14 You keep on realizing this, look I am becoming miserable, I am becoming miserable.
8:19 Then there is a way to come out of it.
8:22 You don't know anything.
8:24 You just get overpowered by this misery of craving.
8:28 And then you don't know how you become addicted to this craving.
8:32 This becomes worse.
8:34 Sensation becomes addicted to craving.
8:39 When you start observing sensations, a stage will come, sooner, maybe later in some cases,
8:46 where you start understanding that you are actually not craving for this object or that
8:52 object.
8:55 You are craving for a particular sensation.
8:58 When you crave, crave for anything, a sensation arises.
9:04 And when that craving is fulfilled, there is no more sensation.
9:07 And you want that sensation again.
9:09 So you have to crave for something else.
9:11 Once your craving is fulfilled, the object is attained, it becomes still and you want
9:17 something else.
9:18 That is attained, again it becomes still, you want something else.
9:22 You have become addicted to this craving.
9:26 Say somebody is living in a one-bedroom cottage, quite happy, suddenly it comes to his mind.
9:33 Not one-bedroom cottage.
9:35 I must have at least a big house with three bedrooms, alright, and a house with three
9:40 bedrooms.
9:41 Then it must be well furnished.
9:43 This furniture, that furniture, well furnished, alright, well furnished.
9:49 Then that becomes still.
9:50 Then I must have this apparatus, that apparatus, a TV, and a colour TV, and VCR, and a Japanese
9:56 jack, deck, or washing machine, or cleaning machine, or this machine, or that machine,
10:03 and the entire house is full of all these things, no space even to breathe, and yet
10:08 no satisfaction.
10:09 Craving, craving, my car, oh this ordinary car, a tin pot, I must have that model.
10:18 How about having a Toyota?
10:20 And then Toyota comes on, no, no, I must have BWM.
10:25 And then no, no, I must have Mercedes Benz, oh no, I must have Rolls Royce, oh no, and
10:31 then not Rolls Royce of this model or that model, then latest model, latest model, not
10:37 just one, two, a fleet of Rolls Royce.
10:43 Still not contented.
10:44 I must have my own helicopter.
10:47 People have their helicopters.
10:48 I must have a helicopter, alright, helicopter has come, then I must have my aeroplane, my
10:54 own aeroplane.
10:55 Aeroplane has come, now I want a spacecraft.
11:00 I must go to the moon, a spacecraft to take me to the moon, oh that also is still.
11:07 I must have a spacecraft to go to the Mars, to this planet, to that planet, not that,
11:12 to this galaxy, that galaxy, oh sky is the limit, even sky is not the limit, no limit.
11:20 It is a bottomless bucket, you can't fill it.
11:24 Because you have started getting addicted to craving, you are not craving for an object,
11:30 you are craving for the sake of craving, that makes the situation worse and this is what
11:37 happens.
11:40 As you proceed on the path it will become so clear.
11:44 When we say somebody is addicted to alcohol or somebody is addicted to drugs, no, it's
11:50 wrong.
11:51 On the surface level, apparent level, it seems to be so.
11:55 Actually one is addicted to the sensation.
11:57 By taking alcohol one feels a kind of sensation and one wants that sensation again and again.
12:03 So one has to take alcohol again and again.
12:06 One has to take drug again and again.
12:08 The sensation is so important.
12:13 This was the discovery of Buddha, unless you start learning how to observe your sensation
12:19 you cannot come out of any addiction.
12:23 Addiction of alcohol, addiction of drug is nothing compared to your addiction of craving,
12:29 compared to your addiction of aversion.
12:31 So many impurities of the mind, you are addicted to all those impurities and you keep on repeating
12:38 them, repeating them, repeating them, because you are addicted to a particular type of sensation.
12:43 You want the sensation again and again, you generate certain impurities to get that sensation.
12:48 When that is over, again you generate the same sensation by generating this kind of
12:51 negativity.
12:52 This has become the habit pattern of the mind.
12:56 How to come out of it?
12:57 Misery is there, but a way to come out of misery is also there.
13:02 Observe, learn how to observe.
13:07 Whatever is happening, you are silent witness.
13:10 Don't react.
13:12 Like somebody sitting at the bank of the river, the flow of the river is there.
13:18 You do nothing for the flow of the river, it is natural.
13:21 Sitting at the bank you just observe.
13:24 This is more than that.
13:25 A flow of vibration, sensation throughout the body, you are feeling it.
13:31 Like a research scientist, in his lab, in a glass tube, some chemical is there, he heats
13:41 up some liquid chemical and that gets evaporated, volatile matter gets evaporated, and that
13:48 moves in some other tube, gets condensed, comes out as liquid.
13:53 He is just observing, just observing.
13:57 When it gets evaporated, it doesn't start crying, oh where my chemical went away.
14:02 When it comes back again as a liquid form, it doesn't start dancing, he just understands.
14:07 But all that understanding of a scientist is only at the intellectual level, he is not
14:12 experiencing.
14:13 Here you are experiencing the entire physical structure.
14:18 What is this?
14:19 How it is working?
14:21 The mental structure, the combination of the two, the interaction of the two, how one is
14:28 influencing the other, how one gets influenced by the other, how the mind gets originated
14:34 because of matter, how the matter gets originated because of the mind.
14:38 At times it looks as if matter is changing into mind.
14:42 At times it looks as if the mind is changing into matter.
14:45 All that one is experiencing and that makes so much difference.
14:51 Then the wisdom that you get by this experience is your own wisdom.
14:54 Not because Buddha said so.
14:57 Not because your teacher says so.
14:59 Not because any scripture says so.
15:03 The material structure made of subatomic particles, tiny little kalapas, the entire universe made
15:11 of tiny little kalapas, four basic elements, earth, water, fire, air, and four characteristic
15:24 each of them, the entire universe is like that, entire material universe is like that.
15:33 You see things, solid earth element, liquid water element, air, gaseous air element, and
15:43 the temperature prevailing everywhere, fire element, the snow, solid, turns into water,
15:53 gets evaporated as gas, and there is temperature in all the three cases.
15:58 Similarly in our body also, bones, etc., so solid earth element, blood, etc., water element,
16:06 gaseous, etc., air element, and the temperature prevailing, fire element.
16:14 But that is not the deeper level of the reality.
16:19 The characteristic of each element which you experience at the sensation level, this is
16:26 more important.
16:29 When you talk of earth element, not that you look for a particle of dust in this element,
16:36 nothing doing.
16:38 Water element, you don't look for a drop of water in it, nothing doing.
16:42 What is the sensation that you feel because of that earth element?
16:48 The entire field of weight from the heaviest sensation feeling to the lightest is the characteristic
16:58 of the earth element.
17:03 Like pulverized cement dust, light, it becomes solidified, becomes heavy, when it is solidified
17:14 it is rough, when it is pulverized it is fine, soft, you get sensations like that, heavy,
17:21 solidified sensation of one type, very rough, that gets dissolved and then you have soft,
17:28 same earth element but very soft.
17:32 All the field of weight is the characteristic of the earth element.
17:38 Only the entire field of movement from the little movement to very big movement is the
17:46 element of air.
17:49 The entire field of temperature from the coldest to the hottest is the field of fire element
17:59 and the water element, binding nature, cohesiveness.
18:07 The entire structure is within your boundary, is bound up.
18:11 This is water element, this is what you experience.
18:16 All the sensations that you have been experiencing till now and all the experiences that you
18:21 will experience in future, you have only these four elements manifesting with this sensation
18:25 or that sensation.
18:27 At times masses of subatomic particles will arise with the predominance of earth element
18:32 or with the predominance of water element or with the predominance of air element or
18:37 with the predominance of fire element, that's all, these four elements are there.
18:42 A good meditator will not get affected.
18:47 Oh, now, masses of kalapas have arisen with earth element, predominance of earth element.
18:56 Let me see how long they last, fire element, let me see how long they last, water element,
19:01 let me see how long they last, air element, let me see how long they last, it does not
19:06 react, one just observes and these sensations which are manifestation of different elements,
19:12 they arise, sooner or later they pass away, they arise, sooner or later they pass away,
19:18 it becomes clearer, clearer, like a scientist, you are exploring the truth, the nature of
19:25 these kalapas and you are also exploring the truth of your mind, how the mind gets influenced.
19:32 How you understand how these kalapas get originated, how they multiply, how the mind gets influenced
19:38 by them and how you react and the reaction gets multiplied, all that phenomena becomes
19:44 so clear, so clear.
19:48 These kalapas, subatomic particles, how they arise, how they get originated, four kinds
19:59 of food you give to them, two material food and two mental food, material input and mental
20:08 input are responsible for the generation of different types of kalapas in your body and
20:14 that you will start experiencing as you proceed on the path it will become clearer and clearer.
20:21 The material food, the food that you take once, twice or three times during the day,
20:27 what type of material food you have taken, that type of kalapas will start arising with
20:33 the predominance of this element or that element, for example as you proceed on the path and
20:38 you become more and more sensitive to your sensations, it will become very clear.
20:44 Say one day you have taken real hot food, Indian hot food, lot of chillies and then
20:50 you sit for meditation after some time and you get a burning sensation here and a burning
20:54 sensation here, the fire element, you are given that input and the fire element, atoms
21:00 are arising with the predominance of fire element.
21:04 You have taken very stale food or very greasy food and you sit for meditation, earth element,
21:10 you feel so heavy, so heavy here, so what type of food you are taking, you take healthy
21:15 food your body becomes healthy, you take unhealthy food your body becomes unhealthy, law of nature.
21:22 The material input, the material input of the atmosphere around you, every moment the
21:28 body keeps on sucking the material atmosphere around, one lives in a cold country, cold
21:35 climate, one type of body, lives in hot country, hot climate, another type of body, this kind
21:42 of kalapas get generated because of the atmosphere around, two other input, mental inputs.
21:50 Your present mind, at this moment, my mind is generating this particular sankhara.
21:58 This sankhara, this type with this sankhara, this mind with this sankhara will start generating
22:04 this atomic kalapas particles with particular type of element.
22:10 Like at this moment I generate anger, I have generated anger at the mental level but the
22:17 kalapas that I have started generating are kalapas with the predominance of fire element,
22:22 burning, burning, burning or I generate a fear, fear sankhara and then trembling, trembling,
22:31 air element, air element, what type of input I am giving at the mental level at this moment,
22:38 how the mind turns into matter or influences the matter or makes the matter to originate
22:44 in a particular way.
22:47 And then the fourth input is your old sankharas.
22:52 The reality of the mind is every moment it is influenced by the sankhara.
22:58 The present sankhara either you keep on generating sankhara from moment to moment, you stop generating
23:03 sankhara as you practice in vipassana, you don't generate any sankhara at this moment,
23:08 then your old stop will start coming up on the surface.
23:13 This is the fruit of your old sankharas.
23:16 In your daily life also as you get established in the technique, it will be very clear, you
23:23 get something unpleasant happens in your life.
23:27 Before that something unpleasant happens in the life outside, very unpleasant sensation
23:32 has started in you and then only something unpleasant happens in the life.
23:37 Something very pleasant happens in the life, a pleasant sensation has started in you.
23:41 So the fruit first comes as a sensation.
23:44 The seed was planted as a sensation, say a seed of anger, my sankhara of anger.
23:51 As I plant the seed of anger, I feel so much heat.
23:56 Fruit of this particular sankhara when it comes up, it will come up with the same kind
24:00 of sensation, again heat, very much heat.
24:04 So the sankhara that I am generating now is one input and it creates fire element in
24:11 the body.
24:12 And the sankhara of the past, if it is a sankhara of anger, the fruit of that will again have
24:17 fire element.
24:18 Like this the sankhara now or the sankhara past are another two reasons for different
24:23 kind of kalapas to arise, different kind of kalapas to arise.
24:27 As you keep on observing, then you understand that more and more I react to these sensations,
24:36 more and more I generate new sankharas and I create more and more misery for me.
24:42 And if I stop generating new sankharas, then the old ones come on the surface, they create
24:47 a sensation and again I smile at the sensation, this is also impermanent, let me see how long
24:53 it lasts, let me see how long it lasts, it passes away.
24:57 That means layers of that particular old sankhara has come on the surface and passed away.
25:03 Chunks after chunks will come on the surface and pass away.
25:05 You are relieved from that.
25:08 You are not generating a new sankhara.
25:10 You are getting liberated from your old stock of the sankharas.
25:14 And the process is such, it will take you to the stage.
25:18 Everyone who keeps on working, working properly, of course it takes time.
25:22 Not that one becomes perfect by taking a ten day course, but by ten day course one understands
25:27 this is how I have to work.
25:28 And one keeps on working, keeps on working, ultimately one reaches the stage where there
25:33 is no more past sankharas left.
25:35 And you don't generate a new sankhara.
25:37 And this is what is called kheenam puranam navam natthi sambhavam, kheenam puranam.
25:45 The old stock is eradicated now.
25:47 And no new sankhara can be generated.
25:50 One is a liberated person.
25:52 And this happens by one's own practice.
25:55 No one else can do that for you.
25:58 The sankharas that is accumulated is accumulation of your own.
26:02 You have accumulated them.
26:03 You are responsible for that.
26:04 Your ignorance is responsible for that.
26:07 Slowly you are coming out of that ignorance.
26:09 You are developing your wisdom, living wisdom, wisdom at the experiential level.
26:15 And you see how the old stock is getting eradicated, eradicated.
26:19 You are coming nearer and nearer to the final goal.
26:23 Each individual has to work.
26:26 No one else can do anything for you, can only just show the path.
26:31 Hindrances are there, difficulties are there.
26:36 In the language of those days, it is called nivarana, like curtain, thick curtains which
26:43 won't allow you to see the things behind the curtain.
26:46 You can't see the reality within you because of these nivaranas, these obstacles, these
26:53 barriers, five big nivaranas, five big barriers.
26:57 I call them five big enemies of every meditation, vipashyana meditator, five big enemies.
27:05 Two big enemies, craving and aversion.
27:11 You are meditating to come out of your old habit of craving, to come out of your old
27:16 habit of aversion.
27:18 And ignorantly you are meditating.
27:21 You are meditating and multiplying your craving.
27:24 You are meditating and multiplying your aversion.
27:27 You are supposed to come out of craving, you are supposed to come out of misery, of craving.
27:31 You are supposed to come out of the misery of aversion and look what you started doing.
27:36 This is because of the old habit pattern of the mind, because of the ignorance, because
27:40 of these nivaranas, these two nivaranas, two barriers.
27:44 An example, how it happens.
27:48 In a course like this, there are many reasons for asking the students, no communication,
27:54 don't talk with the fellow student.
27:55 If any problem, come and discuss with the assistant teacher or the teacher.
28:01 But keep on working your own, keep on working your own.
28:04 But human mind is human mind.
28:07 Always inquisitive about others.
28:10 You get one opportunity and you start talking, hey, how about you?
28:13 How about you?
28:14 And this person replies, I got a flow of tingling vibrations, tingling throughout the body?
28:19 And I didn't get any tingling?
28:23 And somebody says I got a flow of electric current throughout the body.
28:26 Electric current?
28:27 Wonderful.
28:28 I didn't get.
28:29 And when you sit for meditation now, I want tingling sensation, I want electric current
28:34 or no electric current for me, no tingling sensation for me.
28:38 And you keep craving, craving, craving.
28:43 You are here to come out of craving.
28:45 And in the name of meditation, in the name of Ipashyana, you started craving, craving.
28:50 Craving is craving, misery.
28:53 Even if you crave for the final goal, liberation, nirvana, I want nibbana, I want nibbana, you
28:59 are running in the opposite direction of nibbana.
29:03 Nibbana is a stage free from craving and you are multiplying your craving.
29:07 How can you reach the stage of free from craving?
29:10 By generating craving, not possible.
29:13 So whenever you find this enemy is overpowering you, come out of it as quickly as possible.
29:18 Don't allow it.
29:20 Whatever comes about this moment, this sensation or that sensation, even no sensation, doesn't
29:25 matter.
29:26 You accept the reality of this moment as it is, as it is.
29:32 What is not there, you want that.
29:35 Then again, the same old habit pattern, what is not there, you want that.
29:39 And that becomes craving.
29:40 And you start having attachment to this craving.
29:43 It becomes a big misery for you.
29:46 Similarly aversion.
29:47 An example, you are made to sit for one hour, Adikthana, you can't open your eyes, you can't
29:55 open your legs, you can't open your hands.
29:59 You somehow manage half an hour, you manage 45 minutes.
30:05 After that, then the torture starts.
30:08 And again the same human mind, inquisitiveness about others, you are not supposed to open
30:13 your eyes.
30:14 And still you open a little bit of eye.
30:17 What is happening to others?
30:18 Is this pain, I am only suffering with pain or everybody is suffering with pain?
30:22 You are so curious about others.
30:26 And you notice, at that time everybody is sitting like a statue of Buddha.
30:31 That means they have got no pain, only I have got pain.
30:34 My pain has not gone away, everybody's pain has gone away.
30:38 Oh, this pain, then your aversion becomes multiply, aversion towards this pain.
30:43 My teacher keeps on saying everything is anicca, anicca, impermanent, impermanent, may be true,
30:49 but this pain is permanent.
30:51 This is not impermanent.
30:52 Look, how many times I told you, you are anicca, you are anicca, and still it is not going?
31:00 This is permanent, this is permanent.
31:03 Aversion, aversion, aversion.
31:06 Every enemy has overpowered you, you are multiplying aversion, you are here to come out of aversion
31:12 and you started multiplying the aversion.
31:15 Another two big enemies.
31:18 Understand all these enemies, they are defilements, mental defilements, which came in your body,
31:25 in your mind, as guests, and then they became owner of the house.
31:31 They don't want to go out.
31:33 Because when you practice vipashyana, they can't stay, they have to go out.
31:37 Like a switch on, light comes on, the darkness has to go.
31:40 You won't have to tell darkness who, you go away now, now there is light.
31:43 When you practice vipashyana, these defilements have to go, and they don't want to go.
31:48 So they give a kick from within, stop vipashyana.
31:51 This is not good for me, I don't want to go, stop vipashyana.
31:55 Two kinds of kicks are given from within.
31:58 One big kick is that it will make you so drowsy, you have a sound sleep, all right?
32:04 You sit for meditation, you feel so drowsy, so drowsy, a very big enemy is overpowering
32:10 you.
32:11 Fight it out.
32:12 Have heart breathing, if that doesn't work.
32:14 And if it is not that one hour sitting, stand up and meditate with heart breathing.
32:19 That doesn't work.
32:20 Get out, walk five minutes or ten minutes, observe your sensation or respiration, come
32:24 and sit.
32:25 Keep on fighting this enemy.
32:27 Otherwise this enemy overpowers you, you can't meditate.
32:33 Another kick from within, either this kick will make you very much drowsy or it will
32:38 make you very much agitated.
32:40 You feel like doing little bit of this, feel like doing little bit of this, little bit
32:45 of this, little bit of this, but no meditation.
32:49 You are in one hour sitting adikthana, and a kick from within, you have taken whole of
32:54 your body outside, and then you realize, oh I was in adikthana, how I came here.
32:58 A kick from within won't allow you to practice properly.
33:02 This enemy, dangerous enemy, another enemy, fifth enemy, doubt, doubt, all kinds of doubt
33:11 come in the mind.
33:13 What is this technique?
33:14 What sort of technique is this?
33:16 Observe respiration, observe respiration.
33:18 Even when I was not observing respiration, it was there all the time.
33:22 What I gained by observing respiration?
33:24 Now observing the heat, observing the perspiration, what I am doing?
33:27 Have I gone crazy?
33:28 What kind of meditation?
33:32 And this doubt will not allow you to work.
33:35 Another doubt at times, another doubt comes about your teacher.
33:39 What teacher?
33:41 I was expecting a great guru from India with capital G. What kind of guru?
33:48 He doesn't have matted long hair, doesn't have big moustache or beards, even no shaven
33:54 head, and he has got no bunches of rosaries around his neck, no trademark on his forehead,
34:00 no paraphernalia of a teacher.
34:02 No guru.
34:03 What kind of guru?
34:04 He doesn't look like a freak, he looks like a straight, what guru?
34:18 No.
34:19 And he has got no supernatural power, he can't fly in the air, he can't dig dips in the earth.
34:25 He and his assistant keep on asking, how about you?
34:27 They should know what, how about you?
34:29 Why they ask a student?
34:32 No supernatural power.
34:35 Doubt, doubt, and you can't work.
34:38 Third kind of doubts come.
34:40 Yes, the technique is good because so many people keep coming and they get benefit, they
34:44 keep coming repeatedly.
34:46 It is good.
34:47 Teacher is also good because so many people listen to him, so perhaps good, alright.
34:52 I am not good.
34:54 I am not fit for this.
34:55 Doubt about one's own capability.
34:57 I am not fit.
35:00 This is not the time for me.
35:02 And this scene is not for me.
35:05 I better quit.
35:08 And one feels like running away.
35:09 Oh, this doubt, doubt, doubt, any of these three doubts overpowers you and you stop meditating.
35:16 These five nivranas, five enemies, be careful, don't allow them to overpower you and then
35:22 you will find you are progressing, you are progressing, you are progressing.
35:26 The technique is wonderful.
35:29 There is no dogma involved in it, no blind faith involved in it, no cult involved in
35:34 it.
35:35 It is pure science of mind and matter, the interaction of mind and matter.
35:39 How out of ignorance this mind keeps on reacting to these sensations, keep on generating negative
35:47 and because of these negativities more and more this particular type of sensation arises
35:51 and when that sensation arises you more react with negativity and this vicious circle becomes
35:56 miserable, more and more miserable, you start observing it, you start coming out of it.
36:02 Just universal law of nature, nothing to do with this particular organized religion or
36:08 that organized religion, truth is truth, universal truth, universal law, dhamma is universal
36:15 law, natural law and that will become clearer and clearer if you keep on working.
36:22 The law of nature is such that if you keep on reacting with negativity you are multiplying
36:27 your misery.
36:29 You stop this reaction, you have started coming out of misery and this has worked even in
36:34 the past, this works now, this will keep on working in future.
36:38 Even in the past whether there was a Buddha or no Buddha, Buddha says whether I am there
36:43 or not, whether somebody becomes an enlightened or not, the law of nature remains the same,
36:49 it is eternal.
36:51 All the time when one generates negativity one is bound to suffer, all the time one starts
36:56 coming out of negativity one starts getting liberated from the misery.
37:01 A Buddha discovers this law remains covered, people do not know what is happening, deep
37:08 inside how you generate negativity people do not know.
37:13 One's enlightenment is that he goes deep inside and finds out how one keeps on generating
37:18 negativities to these sensations and keeps on multiplying one's misery.
37:23 How observing the sensation one can come out of this misery, come out of the negativity,
37:28 this is found out by somebody which is there already, the law is there already and then
37:33 out of compassion he starts teaching it to others, giving this technique to others, people
37:37 follow it and they come out of their misery.
37:40 This happened to thousands upon thousands of people in the life of the Buddha and after
37:46 that also during these 25 centuries whoever practiced got the same benefit and even in
37:52 future who will be practicing will get the same benefit, today anybody is practicing
37:57 will get the same benefit, the law is law, it is eternal, the same law.
38:02 E sa dhammo sanantara, the dhamma is eternal, the same law prevails.
38:10 At the time of Buddha how miserable people came out of their misery not because of any
38:17 miracle or magic of Buddha, the same technique was given.
38:22 One instance of this person Angulimala, a young man very angry, he had taken a vow that
38:30 he will kill 1000 human beings, how much anger he has got and he killed 999 of them
38:39 and he was looking for the thousandth one and how to remember how many he has killed.
38:45 So whomever he kills he cuts the finger and puts a garland around his neck and keeps on
38:51 counting how many fingers and that is why he was called Angulimala, one he is wearing
38:56 a garland of fingers. When he was looking for the 1000th person
39:02 he came across Buddha or rather Buddha out of compassion came to him just to save him
39:08 from his misery, no magic, no miracle, same technique was given to him and he started
39:15 realizing that he is a miserable person full of misery and started working on it and working
39:22 he came out of misery. Here is the final goal of full liberated person,
39:28 an anaharanth, full of compassion, full of love, full of goodwill for others and now
39:35 he goes around from village to village, from countryside to countryside, from city to city,
39:41 everywhere people are so miserable, I was so ignorant, out of my ignorance I had been
39:46 harming myself, I had been harming others, like me there are so many who are harming
39:51 themselves, they are harming others, if they get this wonderful technique certainly they
39:56 will come out of their misery, certainly they will come out of their misery.
39:59 So out of compassion he goes to different places, teaches this dhamma, this technique
40:05 to others. Some people recognize him, although he has
40:10 become a monk now, he is the same Angulimala who has killed my mother or killed my father
40:14 or killed my wife or killed my husband or killed my son, same Angulimala and out of
40:19 anger they throw stones at him, they beat him, blood starts flowing from his body, but
40:25 from the heart only compassion flows, oh miserable people, I was also equally miserable, out of
40:33 ignorance I was harming myself, I was harming others.
40:37 See this technique how it helps you, you will come out of all your misery, give it trial,
40:43 full of compassion, the whole life full of compassion.
40:49 How miserable people came out of their misery so easily, of course by practicing the technique
40:54 understanding that this technique alone can take us out from the misery, unless we come
40:59 out of our negativities, unless we come out of our sankharas, there is no liberation from
41:04 misery. A very miserable woman by the name of Kisa
41:09 got married and for number of years had no issue and she was craving for a child, after
41:19 a number of years she got a child, unfortunately within two years the child died, she had developed
41:27 so much of attachment to the child and the child died, this sorrow was unbearable for
41:32 her, she took the dead body corpse of the child to the breast and she won't give it
41:38 to the people to take to the cremation ground, to take to the graveyard, no my child has
41:43 not died, it is sleeping, please do something so that he gets awakened, please do something
41:48 and people say no mother, he has died and no use expecting that he will wake up, but
41:56 she has gone totally insane, no I can't give, my son has not died, has not died, please
42:02 do something, please do something, one wise person told her, nobody has got any medicine
42:09 for this dead body, you may go to Buddha, he has got his meditation center here, you
42:14 go there, perhaps he may do something for you and she went to Buddha, placed the dead
42:20 body before his feet and crying, crying, my son has not died, people say he is dead, even
42:27 if he is dead, please do something, please do something, Buddha found that her mind
42:32 was so emotionally unbalanced, any kind of dhamma teaching will not work there, he had
42:37 his own way of teaching, asked her alright, go to the city, get a few grains of sesame,
42:46 very happy, Buddha is going to do something for my son, Buddha said wait, listen to the
42:52 instruction properly, you must bring these seeds of sesame from some house where nobody
42:58 has died, from a family where nobody has died, yes, yes sir, I will bring that and she went
43:04 out from house to house, from street to street, every house she is asking for sesame seed,
43:12 my son has died and Buddha is going to do something, please give me, oh you may take
43:17 bag full of seeds, may your son get alive and then she questions has anybody died in
43:23 your family and with a long face she says yes, my father has died or my mother has died
43:27 or my brother has died or so and so has died and the next house and the next house, notice
43:32 single house she got where somebody has not died and by that time the whole day she came
43:39 to senses, there is no house, there is no family where somebody does not die, this is
43:45 law of nature, people take birth to die sooner or later and now her mind was in a position
43:51 to learn Dhamma, she came back and Buddha gave Dhamma, the same Dhamma, observe respiration,
43:57 observe sensation, go deeper, deeper, deeper and you find all your misery will get evaporated
44:03 layers after layers and this Kisa Gautami became an Arahant, fully liberated and all
44:10 her life serving people like me, so many mothers, like me so many sisters, oh they are so miserable,
44:19 if they get this wonderful Dhamma they will come out of their misery, out of this compression
44:23 kept on serving people in Dhamma, kept on serving people in Dhamma. Another miserable
44:30 person like this, daughter of a very rich person Patachara, she also lost her husband,
44:37 she had two sons, lost both the sons, lost her brother, mother, father, now nobody was
44:44 there in the wide world and she became insane, total insane, running in the streets of Savati,
44:52 totally naked and people throwing stones at her and she won't understand what is happening.
44:58 Because of some past parmi, some good karmas of the past she came in contact with Buddha,
45:05 Buddha was teaching Dhamma to others and she passed by and Buddha said, come my child
45:12 and she came there and as she sat down she got senses even for a few minutes and she
45:18 found that she is naked, somebody threw a cloth over her and from then onwards she was
45:23 called Patachara, her name was Patachara. Buddha gave Dhamma, the same technique and
45:31 working on it, working on it, she came out of all her miseries. If Buddha had used some
45:36 miraculous powers to give life to the son of Kisa Gautami or give life to the sons of
45:43 this Patachara or the husband of Patachara or the mother, father, brother of Patachara
45:48 then Buddha would not have been Buddha. Give Dhamma, this is a temporary relief, even if
45:56 somebody gets life again, it's a temporary relief, misery is there all the time. One
46:02 starts understanding as one progresses on the path a time comes one can remember the
46:07 past lives after lives and Buddha says you just see lives after lives, countless lives,
46:15 how many of your relatives, your dear ones have passed away, they have died. If you just
46:21 accumulate the bones of all those who have died in the past and you accumulate it will
46:25 be like a huge mountain and the tears that you have shed with every dear one who has
46:31 died, if you accumulate all those tears it will be like a huge ocean. You want to carry
46:37 on the same thing in future also, life after life, countless life in future, again rolling
46:43 in misery, come out of it, here is a way, here is a technique, enough is enough, you
46:49 have suffered so much, come out of it now, come out of it and he gives this technique
46:54 which is just law of nature, everybody works on it, whoever works comes out of it and it
47:00 is not necessary also that to work on this technique one must come out of the householder's
47:06 life, one should become a monk or a nun, well if one becomes a monk or a nun there are less
47:11 responsibilities of the worldly's life and one can work, give full time to this, the
47:17 work becomes easier but this is not absolutely essential, Dhamma is for everyone. A recluse,
47:22 a monk or a nun or a householder, householder may have difficulties because of so many responsibilities
47:28 but still the path is the same for both, hardly there were hundred thousand monks or nuns
47:34 with him and rest of them, millions of them in northern India, practicing vipashna and
47:40 coming out of their misery, practicing vipashna and coming out of their misery, an incident
47:46 of a very rich person, a multimillionaire of those days, anath pendika, he used to give
47:54 lot of dana, lot of dana because tradition is such that a householder must give dana,
48:03 if one does not give dana then there is more of ego, as a householder one is not supposed
48:10 to beg food from others, for a monk it is alright, for a nun it is alright, as a householder
48:19 one has to earn money, properly, honestly, hard workingly but when you start earning
48:26 money then the madness comes, I am so smart, I am so intelligent and that is why I am earning
48:34 so much money, this ego, one starts living ego centred life, self centred life and starts
48:41 hating everybody else, oh these people, ignorant people, they are not intelligent, they are
48:46 not smart, they are not hard working, that's why they are not earning and I look, I am
48:50 so smart, I am so intelligent, I am so hard working, this ego comes, which is dangerous.
48:57 The whole purpose of giving dana was to come out of the ego and the same dana makes one
49:03 ego centred person, one has lost dhamma, one doesn't know what for I am giving dana,
49:09 this person was giving lot of dana, this title anatha pendaka, anath means orphans, those
49:16 who are very poor, pendaka, one who gives them food, that was his title because he was
49:21 giving so much food to all hungry people, he had branches of his business throughout
49:27 India and beyond India in different countries and this was a rule that wherever his office
49:31 or branches there, nobody should remain, go hungry there, people should get food, but
49:36 still he didn't know dhamma, came in contact with Buddha, that means came in contact with
49:41 dhamma, got vipassana, practising, practising, purified the mind, purified the mind, got
49:47 the first dip of nibbani stage, changed person altogether, now he was a changed person altogether,
49:55 now giving donation is not to build ego, is to deflate ego, is to dissolve ego, all this
50:03 money that has come to me, it is because of my past good karmas it has come to me, it
50:08 must be used for the good of others, of course as a householder I must make use of it for
50:13 my own maintenance, for the maintenance of all those who are depending on me, but the
50:17 rest of it must go for the good of others, for the good of others, and now he understands
50:24 the good of others, which is the real good of others, I give food to a hungry person,
50:31 I must give, it's alright, but next day again this person is hungry, I give water to a thirsty
50:37 person, after some time again he may become thirsty, I give some medicine to a sick person,
50:43 he may get another disease, or the same disease may come up again, I may give clothes to a
50:47 naked person, after some time the clothes get worn, torn, and again he is naked, I am
50:53 not taking out, I am not helping people to come out of all their miseries, if they get
50:57 dhamma, if they get this wonderful technique of viparshana, oh they come out of their misery,
51:05 total liberation from misery, misery that they were encountering from life after life,
51:11 they will come out of it, dhamma should go to each and every suffering person, besides
51:16 all the time giving material dana, this dana is most important, sabba dana, dhamma dana,
51:24 the dana of dhamma is the highest dana, and he goes to Buddha, Buddha at that time was
51:31 living in Rajgiri, pays respect to him and tells sir, why not come to Savasthi, he was
51:38 living in Savasthi, which was the most populated city of India of those days, most populated
51:44 city, large number of people are miserable, all miserable, rich or poor, if you have a
51:52 meditation center there, so many people will get benefit sir, please do something, come
51:57 there, Buddha smiled, so he understood that Buddha has agreed, he came back home, looking
52:04 for a center, a place where Buddha can start teaching dhamma to people, meditation center
52:10 should not be in the midst of the city with so much of noise and all, it should not be
52:15 very far away where people cannot go, so looking for a proper place, peaceful and yet not very
52:21 far away from the city, he came across a garden, a park, very calm, very quiet, congenial for
52:29 meditation, and he enquired who is the owner of this park, and he came to know that the
52:36 prince, the son of the king is the owner, prince Jayata, and he went to him, sir I want
52:43 to buy your park, and the prince became very angry, I am not here to sell my park, this
52:49 is for my own amusement, I can't sell it, no sir I have to buy, any price, just to get
52:56 rid of him, the prince says you know the price of this land, you have to spread gold sovereigns,
53:02 the entire land, this is the price, the deal is done, I will spread sovereigns, cart loads
53:09 of sovereigns he is bringing and spreading, the prince says have you gone mad, no land
53:15 can be that valuable, what are you doing, are you a mad person, he says no I am not
53:19 mad, this land is going to become so valuable, Buddha is going to come here and teach wonderful
53:26 vipashana, and all my wealth is nothing compared to one person getting vipashana, even one
53:33 person comes out of the misery, my wealth is nothing compared to that, and I know not
53:38 one person, thousands upon thousands will get benefit, and immediately meditation centre
53:44 where ten thousand people can live, stay, meditate, learn dhamma, this volition to serve
53:51 others, dana was there even previously, now the dana is how more and more people will
53:56 get benefited, not to inflate his ego, to deflate his ego, dissolve the ego, just to
54:03 serve others, serve others, this multimillionaire it so happened that due to some karmas of
54:10 the past he became a pauper for a short period, he had no money, he is a pauper, and when
54:22 he was a money person he will come to this centre every day morning and evening to meditate,
54:28 and as a householder he understands I should not go to the centre empty handed, I must
54:32 carry something for the meditators, and every time he comes he brings something for the
54:36 meditators, now he is a pauper, he has got nothing to bring, and then something comes
54:42 in his mind, behind his house he has got a small garden, and in that garden he has accumulated
54:50 very good fertile soil from different parts of India, now he takes two handful of that
54:54 earth, fertile earth, comes to the centre, under a tree, at the root of the tree, may
55:01 this tree grow, under the shade of this tree, may someone get dhamma, may someone get meditation,
55:08 volition is there, whether handful of earth or millions of rupees makes no difference,
55:15 volition, it is the volition that counts, after some time again he became multimillionaire,
55:21 started giving the volition in the same way, he understands dhamma now, that whatever I
55:26 give the amount is a material, my volition, my dhamma volition for the good of others,
55:32 for the benefit of others, not expecting anything in return, when one does not know dhamma,
55:39 then one keeps on giving dana, but inflating the ego, one builds a big hospital, a school,
55:47 a college, but wants it to be named a goinka hospital, a goinka school, a goinka college,
55:57 and this name must be written in golden letters at the gate, goinka school, goinka college,
56:02 madness, one does not know what one is doing, the whole volition is wrong, understanding
56:09 of dhamma is wrong, the volition is to give without expecting anything in return, to give
56:15 for the benefit of others, for the benefit of others, how people started changing, changing
56:20 in their life, different people, householders, one mother Visakha, again a daughter of a
56:32 very rich person, married to another rich person, but the family had no dhamma at all,
56:37 and how very wisely she turns the entire atmosphere of this family where there was no dhamma,
56:45 how everybody became a good meditator and changed the whole attitude of the family,
56:50 and the whole family became full of peace, harmony, where there was so much of tension
56:55 and misery, how dhamma starts working, brings peace for one and all, and this was not merely
57:03 at the time of Udthar, it kept on, whoever worked, whenever one worked, the same result
57:09 comes. One incident in the life of my teacher, C. R. G. Ubakhine, when Burma became independent,
57:20 there were small, small states, princely states, and a person, a good politician, statesman,
57:26 he amalgamated all these states and made a union of Burma, and to satisfy these princes,
57:32 one of their leader was made the president of the country, of the union of Burma. Now
57:37 president has got no power according to the constitution there, the prime minister has
57:40 all the powers, and yet this person becomes so happy that I am now the president of the
57:45 union of Burma. Previously I was just a ruler of a small place, very happy. One evening
57:55 he gives a big party, all the diplomats and the elite of the city, they all come there,
58:01 a big party, 7.30 is the time to start the party, everybody has come, all the guests
58:07 have come, the host is not to be seen, 7.45 the host is not to be seen, 8 o'clock the
58:13 host is not coming, the prime minister got worried, what's going on, he sends somebody
58:17 to the residence on the first floor, and those who went up there came back and told him,
58:23 sir he can't come, why, what happened, he has drank so much, he is unconscious lying
58:29 on the floor, he can't come, but without the host how can this party, this is the president's
58:34 party, conscious or unconscious, bring him somehow, let us start the party, and two of
58:39 them helped him to come, half conscious, half unconscious, hiccupping, hiccupping, and he
58:44 comes, he is made to sit on the main chair, and the course, and the dinner starts, first
58:50 course is served, second course is served, when the third course was being served he
58:55 started vomiting, vomiting, prime minister was so unhappy, we call our land a dhamma
59:01 land, our government a dhamma government, and what sort of president we have got, what
59:06 could be done, next day when he came to census he telephoned to prime minister, if you want
59:11 I will resign, but I cannot come out of alcohol, it is impossible, in our royal tradition when
59:18 the heir to the throne is born, that means the first son to the king is born, then the
59:23 first input given is the best quality alcohol, in a silver spoon or a gold spoon, this was
59:29 my first input sir, and since then I am taking alcohol, alcohol, half of my blood has become
59:35 alcohol, I can't come out, can't come out of alcohol, now this person, fortunate because
59:42 of some good parmi of the past, one day he passes in front of the teacher's siyaji ubhakin
59:48 teacher, just out of inquisitiveness enters there, and that was the day, the tenth day,
59:53 the last day, and he sees everybody's face blooming, operation is over now, and bomb
59:58 is given on the wounds, everybody smiling, smiling, hey what's going on here, meditation
1:00:04 is taught, what meditation, anapana is taught, vipashana is taught, being a born buddhist
1:00:09 he has been reading about this anapana and vipashana in the scriptures, but he never
1:00:13 knew that anybody is teaching this, and such results are coming, everybody says we feel
1:00:17 so peaceful, so harmonious, I had no peace in my life, I never know what harmony is,
1:00:25 I am such an agitated person, sir can I come, can I come and also join, yes, yes, whether
1:00:31 a prince or a pauper, anybody, everybody can come and meditate, what shall I have to do,
1:00:37 you have to take five precepts, five precepts, oh no, no, no, four precepts, fifth one is
1:00:44 out of question, I can't do, then go away, we can't take you, and he wants this peace,
1:00:51 and he's not taken, so he starts arguing, starts bargaining, one little peg sir every
1:00:56 day, very little, no, nothing doing, one peg after alternative days, nothing doing, one
1:01:03 in five days, nothing doing, go away, we can't teach you unless you have got this foundation
1:01:07 strong, this five sila, or foundation of meditation, and then he says alright, then somehow I will
1:01:13 control myself, but sir, under one condition, that when I go back home, you should not stop
1:01:20 me from drinking, how can I stop you going back home, you are your own master, you drink
1:01:23 as much as you like, but here no, I would recommend you going back home, you should
1:01:28 not drink, but if you drink, how can I stop you, but these ten days, no drink, alright
1:01:33 sir, I want peace, I want harmony, and he practiced, the same practice, after ten days
1:01:39 he goes to the president house, his own house there, and somebody is drinking even hundred
1:01:44 yards away, he says stinking, who is drinking here, he can't bear, he can't bear others
1:01:48 drinking out of question for him to drink, and the whole ten days nobody told him, if
1:01:54 you go back home and drink, you will get this hell or that hell, nothing doing, in Dhamma
1:01:59 there is no threatening, what happens, what is drink, he is addicted to the sensation
1:02:05 of the drink, and when he learned how to observe the sensation, observe the sensation,
1:02:09 all the Sankharas of the alcohol had gone away, the addiction of alcohol was gone away,
1:02:14 how can he drink now, if this has happened only to one president of the union of Burma,
1:02:19 perhaps there was some miracle involved, this happens to thousands of people coming to courses,
1:02:25 addicted to alcohol, addicted to drug, addicted to this, oh more than that, addicted to craving,
1:02:31 addicted to aversion, addicted to fear, addicted to depression, all these mental illnesses,
1:02:38 how they go away easily, Dhamma is so wonderful, Dhamma is so scientific, Dhamma is so non-sectarian,
1:02:45 Dhamma is so universal, Dhamma is so result oriented, it gives you result here and now
1:02:51 in this very life, good that you have joined the course, make best use of the remaining
1:02:56 four days, they are wonderful days of your life, at least get established in the technique,
1:03:01 how to practice it, it's a lifetime job, you have to work for the whole life, but get established
1:03:07 in the technique, make use of the time, make use of the opportunity, make use of the facility,
1:03:14 make use of this wonderful Dhamma, the wonderful technique, to come out of the bondage of all
1:03:22 the cravings, aversions, illusions, delusions, to enjoy real peace, real harmony, real happiness.
