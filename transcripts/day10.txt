0:09 the 10th day is
0:13 over and tomorrow morning by 7:30 or 8
0:17 we will come to the conclusion of this
0:19 10 day dama
0:22 seminar so this
0:25 evening let us
0:28 review what you break
0:31 during this 10
0:34 days what you have
0:37 practiced so that any aspect of the
0:40 technique if it is not clear it will
0:43 become
0:44 clear if it is clear it will become
0:47 clearer so let us review what you
0:50 did of course the technique is very deep
0:54 in 10 days you have taken just a few
0:57 step on the path and the path is very
0:59 long
1:00 but we won't
1:03 discuss the deeper aspects of the
1:07 technique because according to the
1:10 tradition the theory and the practice
1:12 should go together as much as you
1:15 practice that much the you must
1:17 understand as much the you understand
1:19 that much you practice so whatever you
1:22 practice for 10 days let us
1:25 review what you
1:27 did coming to the course
1:30 first thing that you did
1:32 was that you took refuge in triple
1:37 gem triple
1:40 gem that means gem in
1:43 Buddha gem in
1:45 dhama
1:48 in and means very valuable qualities the
1:52 quality of
1:54 Buddha not in the person of
1:57 budha quality of budha
2:00 quality of
2:02 T quality of
2:07 s
2:11 this tradition of taking refuge in
2:14 triple
2:15 gem has
2:17 unfortunately turned into converting
2:19 people from One organized religion to
2:22 another organized
2:24 religion Buddha was not interested in
2:26 this anybody who becomes real liberated
2:31 really
2:32 enlightened has nothing to do with these
2:38 conversions what will anybody get by
2:41 converting converting people from one
2:44 religion to another
2:47 religion say if all of this
2:49 country or whole the world start calling
2:52 themselves Buddhist and they don't
2:54 practice Sheila samadi or what will they
2:57 gain by this name people people don't
3:00 call themselves Buddhist and they
3:01 practice Sheila samadi and Pa their life
3:04 will become better they will live a
3:06 happier life more harmonious life good
3:08 for them good for others the life will
3:11 be worth living so dhma is to live a
3:15 proper
3:17 life it has nothing to do with those
3:19 organized
3:22 religions quality of Buddha quality of D
3:27 quality of s and out of all these
3:31 three D is ofmost
3:33 importance therefore he kept on
3:36 saying you to take refuge in
3:39 d
3:42 d you to make a island of D for
3:46 Refuge
3:48 D and what
3:50 D not the D which is in the in the
3:55 scriptures no not the dhma that you hear
3:59 from your teacher or you hear from
4:01 Buddha enlightened person not that D the
4:05 D that you practice
4:08 yourself that is D for
4:10 you and this gives you all the
4:13 protection all the
4:15 Refuge so he kept on
4:18 saying take refuge in
4:22 yourself make island of
4:24 yourself develop DH within yourself and
4:28 this DH which you developed with in
4:30 yourself will be your real Refuge none
4:34 else he was not interested in
4:38 establishing a sect but unfortunately in
4:41 his
4:43 name not one but many sects got
4:45 established and the purity of dhma got
4:49 lost
4:51 dhma remains pure only when it remains
4:55 Universal the moment it becomes
4:58 sectarian it loses its
5:01 Essence an enlightened person is not
5:04 interested in
5:06 sectarianism universal law of nature
5:10 this is what he discovers and this is
5:12 what he explains to people and this is
5:14 what he advises people how to apply it
5:17 in
5:19 life that is
5:21 D
5:23 not rights rituals or ceremonies of this
5:26 particular religion or that particular
5:28 ReliOn a philosophical belief of this
5:31 particular religion or that particular
5:33 religion nothing
5:35 doing this is law universal law law of
5:39 nature which is applicable to one and
5:41 all one may keep on calling oneself a
5:44 Buddhist or a Christian or a Hindu or a
5:48 Muslim or a Jew makes no
5:51 difference the law of nature is law of
5:54 nature when you break the law of
5:57 nature you are punished then and
6:01 there if you live in line with the law
6:03 of nature you are rewarded then and
6:05 there you live a very happy life and
6:08 this applies to
6:09 everyone this is what a Buddha discovers
6:13 the law is there Buddha or no Buddha
6:15 even before Buddha this law was there
6:19 somebody breaks the law somebody
6:22 generates anger hatred ill will
6:24 animosity passion fear ego defiles the
6:27 Mind nature starts punishing then and
6:30 there this was there in before Buddha
6:32 this was there at the time of Buddha
6:34 this is there after Buddha it will
6:36 continue to be there and that is why he
6:39 said this isatan that means Eternal this
6:43 is always there a Buddha or no Buddha
6:46 and one who comes out these defilements
6:48 nature starts rewarding one starts
6:50 living a liberated life a happy life
6:52 harmonious life good for oneself good
6:54 for others this was so even before
6:57 Buddha this was so the time of Buddha
6:59 this is so even after Buddha makes no
7:01 difference a Buddha discovers this
7:04 law and applies it in his own life and
7:07 becomes liberated and then out of
7:10 compassion starts Distributing to others
7:12 Distributing to others it always remains
7:15 Universal it has to remain Universal
7:18 otherwise it will lose its
7:21 efficacy a Buddha is not interested in
7:24 sect many of times you find him talking
7:27 to people he say I'm not interested in
7:29 making you my disciple I'm not
7:31 interested I'm not interested in
7:33 Breaking you from your old gurus I'm not
7:36 interested in
7:38 that you have certain aims of your life
7:41 if one has become a recluse a monk or a
7:43 nun or even a householder has some aim
7:46 of the life to get liberated from the
7:48 impurities of the mind I'm here to help
7:50 you in that I got a technique which I
7:53 will teach you and practicing which you
7:55 can come out of the fs and bondages of
7:57 these impurities that's all I'm only
8:00 interested in
8:01 that so very much
8:03 detached at the time when he was passing
8:06 away he
8:08 says I'm not depending on the S I'm not
8:12 depending on these
8:14 people the congregation of the monks the
8:17 saintly people I'm not I'm not depending
8:20 on them and they are not depending on me
8:23 each individual is depending on oneself
8:25 is depending on DH there is no
8:28 sectarianism involved
8:30 dhma is universal and dhma is involved
8:33 this is what you practiced here a Buddha
8:35 is Buddha
8:37 only when he fully established in Dharma
8:41 if there's no Dharma this person will
8:43 keep on calling oneself I am a Buddha I
8:44 am a Buddha not Buddha nothing to do
8:47 with Buddha a saintly person is saintly
8:51 person if is established in DH otherwise
8:54 is not
8:55 a this has to be remembered very well
8:59 that when we take refuge in triple gem
9:02 we take refuge actually in dhma and try
9:05 to develop dhma within ourselves
9:07 understanding fully well the dma that I
9:10 develop Within Myself this dama alone
9:13 can give me all the security can give me
9:15 all the Refuge can give me all the
9:17 protection will help me nothing else can
9:19 help
9:21 me this understanding is there and with
9:24 this understanding one take refuge in
9:26 Buddha DH s the gem in them the quality
9:28 in them
9:30 but at the same time one point should be
9:34 very
9:35 clear anyone who is walking on the path
9:38 of dhma that means purification of the
9:42 Mind there are many yard sticks to
9:44 measure whether this person is really
9:46 progressing in on the path of dma or not
9:49 one yard St two qualities start
9:53 developing in this person very essential
9:56 if these two qualities are not
9:57 developing then understand and this
9:59 fellow is only playing some intellectual
10:01 game or emotional game or devotional
10:03 game he has nothing to do with dma he is
10:05 not practicing D what two qualities one
10:10 quality a feeling to serve
10:13 others without expecting anything in the
10:17 return out of question to expect any
10:20 kind of material gain totally out of
10:23 question but even to expect some name or
10:26 some fame or some position some power
10:28 some status
10:30 oh no then one has not understood dama
10:34 just to
10:35 give just to share what one is
10:37 experienced one has got so much benefit
10:39 from dhma one feels like serving others
10:42 serving others Distributing it to others
10:45 is this quality coming or not if this
10:48 quality is not developing then there is
10:49 something wrong this person is still
10:51 self-centered even he talks of
10:53 Liberation she talks of Liberation once
10:55 own Liberation what I have got to do
10:57 with others then the purification has
11:00 not started Still Still ego centered
11:02 life self-centered life the ego when it
11:05 start starts dissolving dissolving one
11:07 starts feeling about others how can I
11:10 help others how more and more people can
11:12 get dhama this is one quality to serve
11:15 people in dhma without expecting
11:18 anything in
11:19 return second quality to develop a
11:22 feeling of
11:24 gratitude very important even if one
11:27 gets a small little m IAL thing from
11:30 somebody a feeling of gratitude should
11:33 arise to get D although you're not
11:36 taking refuge and Buddha as a person but
11:39 you get dma from Buddha a dhama which
11:42 gave you the path for Liberation which
11:44 has benefited you and you don't have
11:47 even a trace of a feeling of gratitude
11:49 towards the person of Buddha then no
11:52 you're not developing to become Buddha
11:54 is not
11:55 easy countless Life One keeps on
11:58 developing par me these 10 paries which
12:00 we discussed yesterday in big quantity
12:04 to become fully enlightened in very big
12:06 quantity and it takes so many lives and
12:09 one keeps on doing that not just for
12:11 one's own Liberation that one could have
12:13 done by developing these very 10 paries
12:16 in smaller quantity and one could have
12:17 become fully liberated but to reach the
12:20 stage of sama sambha fully enlightened
12:23 to able to serve others one has to
12:25 develop these very 10 qualities in big
12:28 quantity
12:29 and for that Life After Life Life After
12:32 Life the feeling of compassion was there
12:35 always even before he became fully
12:36 enlightened that compassion was there I
12:39 will develop in dhama for the good of
12:41 others of course I will be liberated no
12:43 doubt but also for the good of others
12:45 for the good of
12:46 others if he had not worked so hard he
12:49 would not have become a
12:51 Sasha and even if he had become s samha
12:55 if he had not distributed DH how could
12:58 we put God you would not have God if he
13:01 had decided Well I became fully
13:02 liberated now what's the use of running
13:05 after these worldly people they won't
13:07 understand dama I better go and live in
13:09 a cave somewhere in the Himalayas rest
13:11 of my life and enjoy peace nanic peace
13:14 Within Myself why take all the trouble
13:16 of running after these people then he
13:18 would not have been Buddha compassion
13:20 for the 45 years after the age of 35
13:24 when he became fully enlightened till
13:26 the ripened age of 80 when he passed
13:28 away all 45 years day and night serving
13:31 people serving people and whomever he
13:35 trained and then he sends those trained
13:37 people go out distribute for the good of
13:43 others for the happiness of others for
13:45 the good of others without expecting
13:47 anything in the turn just out of
13:49 compassion serve people in dhama serve
13:52 people in D and like this he started
13:54 spreading and then from teacher to pupil
13:57 from teacher to pupil generation to
14:00 generation how this was maintained in
14:03 its pristine Purity for 25 centuries it
14:06 is not easy so all those people the
14:09 teachers the line of teachers who
14:11 maintained the purity of the technique
14:13 one
14:14 feels a feeling of gratitude towards
14:17 them a feeling of gratitude towards
14:19 Buddha a feeling of gratitude to this
14:21 line of teachers who maintained it in
14:23 its pristine Purity very
14:26 difficult people try to get it polluted
14:30 just to satisfy the
14:32 disciples a disciple wants it in this
14:35 way all right just to please the
14:36 disciple I come from business community
14:38 so I know very well to satisfy the
14:41 clients clients are always right the
14:43 customer is always right customer wants
14:45 this way all that this way wants this
14:47 way this way then one is not a d
14:50 teacher quantity has no meaning quality
14:53 is important even few people practice
14:56 but they should practice in the proper
14:58 way not not just to please people to
15:01 help
15:03 people all this line of teachers how
15:06 they maintained it and in Purity one
15:10 feels very much grateful to them so this
15:13 quality of having developed gratefulness
15:17 towards Buddha is there although it is
15:20 not taking refuge in the person of
15:23 Buddha thinking that he will liberate
15:25 because I have taken refuge in Buddha
15:26 now I can do whatever I like and Buddha
15:28 will liberate me nothing doing this is
15:30 not D it's against you have to liberate
15:33 yourself Buddha only can point out the
15:35 path he has pointed out he has taught
15:37 the technique technique is there people
15:39 have maintained it in Purity one has to
15:41 work on it develop in th and get
15:43 liberated but the feeling of gratitude
15:46 is important that is why this taking
15:49 refuge in triple
15:51 Gem and the next you took five
15:56 precepts understand all these five
15:59 precepts they are parts and Parcels of
16:02 this technique of
16:03 meditation there are many techniques
16:07 even 25 centuries back at the time of
16:10 Buddha there were so many techniques of
16:12 meditation there were so many teachers
16:15 six of them were very renowned teachers
16:18 of those days out of those six renowned
16:20 teachers only one besides Buddha used to
16:24 give importance to Shea morality but all
16:27 the rest just just to please their
16:29 customers you can do whatever you like
16:31 you are free you are free to break
16:33 Sheila if you feel like breaking Sheila
16:35 you want to have this sensual pleasure
16:37 go ahead go do that you want this
16:39 pleasure go ah do that this kind of
16:41 Madness was there and yet each one of
16:44 them announced that I am a Buddha I am
16:46 fully liberated I am fully
16:48 enlightened how soon people forgot about
16:50 them in their lifetime of course they
16:52 became very popular for some time they
16:54 remained popular people thought it is
16:56 very easy you can break your Sheila and
16:58 do what whatever you like and yet you
17:00 can become liberated wonderful this path
17:02 is good but
17:05 ultimately it's it's polluted T it can't
17:08 give you the real benefit of T so even
17:11 in those days even today there might be
17:13 teachers who might tell you Sheila is
17:15 not important but so far as the purity
17:18 of dhma is concerned Sheila is utmost
17:23 important those who keep on breaking
17:25 Sheila and think that they will develop
17:27 on in dama imp
17:29 possible doesn't matter the progress may
17:32 be slow but your Sheila must be perfect
17:35 must be perfect this Foundation should
17:38 not become
17:40 weak and this is not because a Buddha
17:42 says so it is not because a scripture
17:45 says so after all what the technique is
17:47 the technique is to purify the mind at
17:50 the deepest level at the root level and
17:53 whenever you break any of these five
17:56 Sheilas you have to develop your you
17:58 have to generate tremendous amount of
18:01 impurity in your mind when you kill you
18:04 have to develop anger hatred negativity
18:07 then only you kill when you steal you
18:10 have to develop greed craving then only
18:12 you steal when you have sexual
18:14 misconduct then you have to generate lot
18:15 of passion then only you can have sexual
18:17 misconduct like that every Sheila when
18:19 you break a Sheila you have to generate
18:21 lot of impurity in the mind and here you
18:24 have come to practice to purify the mind
18:26 and you keep
18:27 on taking this purity of the mind you
18:30 keep on defiling the mind how can you
18:33 progress on the path without Sheila you
18:37 can't take even the next step of samadhi
18:40 ordinary samadhi people can get it but
18:43 Sama samadi right type of samadi which
18:46 will take you to PA which will take you
18:48 to Liberation is not possible when one
18:51 keeps on Breaking the
18:54 Sheila one is to maintain Sheila and to
18:58 maintain one must develop the Mastery of
19:00 the Mind in a proper
19:02 way now whether one must first practice
19:05 to develop the Mastery of the mind or
19:07 whether one should first practice
19:09 maintenance of Sheila it has become very
19:11 difficult to put the horse before the
19:13 cart or the cart before the horse very
19:15 difficult to find solution such courses
19:18 started even at the time of Buddha come
19:21 to a course like this and because of the
19:24 environment and because of heav program
19:27 from morning 4 4:30 till night 8 9 9:30
19:29 you have no opportunity to break your
19:32 Sheila how will you break Sheila you're
19:34 kept so busy so you are maintaining your
19:36 Seer at the same time you're practicing
19:38 samadi and your samadi is becoming Sama
19:40 samadi right type of samadi a samadi
19:43 with the base of Illusion delusion
19:46 imagination can be practiced without
19:49 sealer a samadi with the base of
19:52 verbalization
19:53 visualization with the base of craving
19:56 with the base of abortion can be
19:57 practiced without
19:59 but this kind of samadhi which wants the
20:02 object object of reality reality
20:05 pertaining to yourself without craving
20:07 without abortion if you want to develop
20:10 This samadi shea is absolutely essential
20:13 so these kinds of camps they help you
20:16 Sheila for good samadhi good samadhi for
20:21 PA samadi was there as I said there were
20:25 teachers in India at the time of Buddha
20:28 even before Buddha who be teaching
20:30 Sheila Sheila was not something new
20:33 which Buddha started teaching similarly
20:35 samadhi was there it was not something
20:37 new that Buddha started teaching he
20:40 himself before he became Buddha he went
20:42 to two other teachers where he learned
20:44 very deep samadhi 7th Jana and the
20:46 eighth Jana seventh absorption samadhi
20:49 and the eighth absorption samadhi which
20:51 today India and the world has lost
20:54 totally he got all that and yet it was
20:58 not the the right Ty all the impurities
21:00 of the mind could not be eradicated by
21:02 that samadhi so he had to develop work
21:06 PA now PA was also there in India even
21:10 before Buddha even at the time of Buddha
21:12 and even after Buddha but the PA was all
21:15 the
21:17 time you read you discuss you talk or
21:20 chintan may or just intellectualize it
21:24 but B may was
21:26 missing how to apply PA in life how to
21:30 live the life of PA the living PA that
21:33 was missing this was the contribution of
21:36 Buddha the samadhi was made very pure
21:40 and that became a contribution of Buddha
21:42 because the object was free from
21:44 ignorance the reality pertaining to
21:46 yourself your
21:48 breath natural breath as it comes in as
21:50 it goes out your Sensations natural
21:53 Sensations pertaining to your own body
21:54 your own mind so you're working with the
21:56 truth truth truth pertaining to yourself
21:59 There Is No Illusion there is no
22:00 delusion there is no craving there is no
22:02 Aion sadii becomes right type of sadii
22:05 PA becomes right type of
22:07 P one has to keep in mind that if one
22:11 really wants to progress on the path the
22:14 purity of the technique must be
22:16 maintained you come for 10 days just to
22:21 examine just to give a trial a Justice a
22:25 full Justice to the technique after 10
22:28 days you are your own masters you find
22:29 that this is good then don't mix up
22:32 anything with it maintain its Purity now
22:35 what is the purity of the technique when
22:38 you work for sadii you started working
22:40 with respiration there are many
22:44 techniques to develop samadhi with the
22:47 help of
22:48 aspiration certain types of practices
22:52 are to regulate the breath to control
22:55 the breath they have their own
22:57 advantages we are not here to to condemn
22:58 other techniques but so far as this
23:01 technique is
23:02 concerned the natural breath as it comes
23:06 in the entire path it uses the
23:10 word as it is not as you would like it
23:14 to be as it is no created reality no
23:19 artificial reality no imposed reality
23:22 the natural reality as it happens from
23:25 moment to moment as it manifest itself
23:27 from moment into movement you are now
23:30 observing the breath natural breath if
23:32 it is deep you just accept the reality
23:35 it is deep if it is shallow you just
23:38 accept the reality it is shallow passing
23:40 through the left nostril passing through
23:42 the left nostril or right nostril right
23:44 nostril both no still both no still if
23:46 it is shallow you don't try to make it
23:48 deep if it is deep don't try to make it
23:50 shallow if it is passing to the left
23:52 don't try to turn it to the right if it
23:54 is right don't turn it to the left just
23:56 accept the reality as it is as it is as
23:59 it is of course sometimes for a very new
24:02 student when the breath is very subtle
24:06 when cannot feel whether the breath has
24:07 come in or going out so when it's
24:09 permitted to take a few just a few
24:12 slightly hard breathings conscious
24:14 breathings intentional breathings but
24:16 that should not remain an object of
24:19 concentration all the time just a few
24:22 and then come back to Natural normal
24:24 soft breathing if it is shallow it is
24:27 shallow soft it is sof develop your
24:29 awareness of the softest breath the
24:31 shallowest breath the finest breath and
24:34 that is how you are sharpening your mind
24:37 another important
24:38 thing while you are feeling your breath
24:41 coming in going out you to keep your
24:43 attention on a small
24:45 area the smaller the area the sharper
24:49 the mind is bound to become if you
24:51 choose a big area of the body somewhere
24:53 and keep your attention there and try to
24:55 feel the breath coming in going out your
24:57 attention will get con concentrated but
24:59 your mind will not become that sharp to
25:01 feel the sub sensation on the body that
25:04 is why he chose NASA he said the front
25:07 part of the nostril keep your attention
25:09 on this area and from here you keep on
25:12 observing the breath coming in going out
25:14 coming in going out and this helps you
25:17 that within 3 days you started feeling
25:19 some sensation or the other and this
25:22 helped you to make your mind so sharp
25:24 that by the time you were on the fourth
25:26 day or the fifth day you started feeling
25:28 Sensations everywhere so area very
25:30 important you to start and you keep on
25:32 working on a smaller area at the
25:34 entrance of the nostrils natural breath
25:37 pure breath bare breath mere breath
25:41 nothing but breath no
25:44 verbalization understanding fully well
25:46 that if you start verbalizing any word
25:48 along with the breath your concentration
25:51 will become easier no imagination no
25:54 visualization understanding fully well
25:56 that if you start having V
25:59 of a shape or a form of any god or
26:02 goddess any founder of religion this
26:04 religion or that religion this Sly
26:06 person that Sly person this unlighted
26:08 person that unlighted person in whom you
26:10 go devotion if you keep on imagining his
26:12 shape or form mind will get concentrated
26:16 but you will miss vas in Vash all
26:19 visualizations are prohibited
26:21 verbalizations are prohibited
26:22 imaginations are prohibited natural
26:25 truth that keeps on manifesting itself
26:27 that's all
26:29 one reason why we don't allow these
26:32 words to be used because most of the
26:34 time the words are nothing but the name
26:36 of this particular God or that
26:37 particular God founder of this religion
26:40 or that religion and then it remains
26:43 limited to a particular sect a God who
26:46 is very much respected by a particular
26:49 sect his or her name will not be recited
26:52 by somebody else belonging to other sex
26:54 and dhma has to be
26:56 Universal because our Melody is
26:58 universal when the Mind becomes impure
27:02 defiled and one starts experiencing
27:05 misery because of that that is not
27:07 limited to a particular sect or a
27:09 particular Community or particular
27:10 country or particular gender it is
27:12 universal so the remedy has to be
27:15 Universal no sectarian remedy can solve
27:18 the problem when you have these words
27:21 and if these are words belonging to a
27:23 particular sect then it can't be
27:25 Universal Universal practice or if you
27:27 have a shape or a form which belongs to
27:30 this particular God or that particular
27:32 go goddess or this religious person or
27:34 that religious person again it gets
27:36 connected with the particular SE this is
27:39 one reason but there is another subtler
27:41 reason also sometimes a student comes to
27:45 me he says I want to verbalize because
27:47 by verbalizing it becomes easy for me to
27:50 get
27:50 concentrated I won't use any sectarian
27:53 word I won't use the name of this God or
27:55 that go when the breath comes in I will
27:57 say one when it goes out I say two this
27:59 is universal anybody can say one two one
28:01 two or coming in going out coming in
28:04 going out good argument is good but
28:08 still we can't allow that
28:10 why because any word you keep on
28:13 repeating that word that word will
28:15 become predominant for you will become
28:17 more important for you you'll forget all
28:18 about the breath mind will get
28:20 concentrated because of this word you're
28:22 repeating this word whether the breath
28:24 is coming in or not you will say in
28:27 whether it is going out or not you will
28:28 say out out in out in out in you forget
28:32 all about the breath 1 2 one two you
28:34 forget all about the breath our purpose
28:36 is not served our purpose is not just to
28:39 concentrate the Mind our purpose is to
28:43 understand the reality pertaining to
28:44 your own structure of mind and matter
28:47 how interaction is going on and you have
28:49 to reach the stage where you start
28:50 feeling the sensations you keep on
28:52 repeating 1 2 one two in out in out mind
28:55 gets
28:56 concentrated but you can't feel the
28:58 sensations you can't understand what is
29:00 happening within you and you miss
29:02 something very important you miss Vash
29:04 therefore no verbalization another
29:07 difficulty with verbalization is that
29:10 every word that you repeat and as you
29:12 keep on repeating it again and again
29:14 every word has its own
29:16 vibration and then masters of Mantra
29:21 they found out that certain words of
29:23 very strong vibrations like a strike a
29:26 Gong and very strong vibration comes
29:29 words like a ring cling be Manas they
29:35 say these words if you keep on repeating
29:37 keep on repeating they generate very
29:39 strong vibration in you you get
29:42 concentrated very easily your entire
29:44 being gets engulfed in that particular
29:47 vibration but understand this is a
29:49 created vibration this is an artificial
29:52 vibration you are missing the natural
29:54 vibration and Via wants you to
29:58 experience the natural
30:00 vibration these created vibrations are
30:03 good good to the extent that they won't
30:06 allow any bad vibration they work like a
30:08 shield for you but they are very harmful
30:11 also because they become a big barrier
30:14 they won't allow you to feel your own
30:16 vibration at the depth of your
30:18 mind what happens when you generate
30:20 anger what happens when you generate
30:22 passion when you generate fear when you
30:24 generate ego that is much more important
30:26 for you because you have to come up out
30:28 of that impurity and if you keep on
30:30 repeating and you generate a particular
30:32 vibration which is artificial created
30:34 vibration and you imposed it then you
30:37 have missed the reality at a deeper
30:38 level therefore no verbalization no
30:41 verbalization similarly no visualization
30:44 the whole technique will take you from
30:47 the apparent truth apparent solidified
30:50 intensified truth say this body
30:53 solidified body and you keep on working
30:55 in V working it turns into mass of
30:59 vibrations mass of atoms this is the
31:00 ultimate truth of the solidified body
31:03 and you now start an imaginary image a
31:07 solidified image and then unless you
31:10 have broken it dissolved it to vibration
31:12 your purpose is not served so why create
31:15 something and then dissolve it create
31:17 something and already you got so much
31:19 the solidity and to dissolve it is so
31:21 difficult therefore no imagination no
31:23 visualization is recommended just the
31:26 Sensation that you experience from from
31:28 moment to
31:29 moment as it happens not not not created
31:35 by you but natural vibration natural
31:37 Sensation that you experience this takes
31:41 you to PA then the whole body you start
31:45 experiencing and you are to observe the
31:49 sensation understand its nature the
31:51 nature of arising passing arising
31:54 passing if you don't understand this
31:57 nature
31:58 of every vibration arising and passing
32:01 then there is every danger that the
32:03 Sensation will result either in craving
32:07 or in avorion and this keeps on
32:09 happening throughout the Life Life After
32:11 Life Sensations are always there and the
32:14 depth of your mind the so-call
32:16 unconscious mind keeps on feeling these
32:19 Sensations all the time it is either
32:21 Pleasant or unpleasant when it is
32:24 Pleasant this part of the Mind keeps on
32:25 reacting with craving craving craving
32:28 but it's unpleasant this part of the
32:30 Mind keeps on reacting with Aion Aion
32:32 Aion this part of the mind which is the
32:34 root of the mind has become a prisoner
32:37 of its own habit pattern all the time
32:39 day and night either craving or hating
32:42 craving or hating craving or hating and
32:45 that keeps on coming on the surface also
32:47 the mind of the surface also is
32:48 influenced by the root and you try to
32:51 rectify your mind at the surface level
32:53 you may be successful for some time but
32:55 if the root is unhealthy you are unti
32:57 enire mass of the mind will remain
32:59 unhealthy this was the discovery of
33:03 Buddha there were many teachers before
33:06 Buddha at the time of Buddha and after
33:08 Buddha India is a very ancient land and
33:11 highly spiritual land where many
33:14 experiments are done for the
33:16 purification of mind for the liberation
33:17 of
33:18 beings but we find all the teachers
33:23 before Buddha contemporary to Buddha and
33:25 after Buddha they all speak in the same
33:28 language you must come out of craving
33:30 you must come out of Aion you must come
33:32 out of ignorance then only you will be
33:35 liberated now craving what craving ation
33:38 what ation these six sense doors and
33:41 their respective
33:43 objects you have to be free from craving
33:46 towards any
33:48 object some shape or form or color or
33:51 light is the object of your eyes you
33:53 like it you develop graving you dislike
33:56 it you develop abortion a sound is the
33:59 object of your ear a sound you like it
34:02 craving you dislike it abortion like
34:04 this the smell for the nose taste for
34:06 the tongue touch for the body and any
34:09 thought or emotion for the Mind these
34:11 six objects every spiritual teacher has
34:14 said don't get indulged in these sensual
34:18 objects otherwise you can never get
34:20 liberated come out of this Buddha also
34:22 said the same thing but Buddha went went
34:25 one step deeper which nobody else could
34:28 do he found out because he worked not
34:31 with any kind of belief or philosophy of
34:33 the past all the beliefs he left aside
34:37 without condemning them he left them
34:38 aside like a scientist he started
34:40 investigating the truth pertaining to
34:43 the Mind pertaining to the matter where
34:45 the misery really starts and observing
34:47 the truth observing the truth he reached
34:49 the
34:56 stage at a very deep level and in short
35:00 he could find out these five kandas five
35:03 Aggregates the aggregate of matter the
35:05 entire physical structure mass of
35:07 kalapas arising passing arising passing
35:10 and four Aggregates of Mind recognizing
35:13 part the recognizing part the feeling
35:15 part the reacting part all this five
35:17 join together they give a ignorant
35:21 feeling I I I am this physical structure
35:26 I am cognizing this this is my cognition
35:29 I am recognizing this is my recognition
35:32 I am feeling this is my feeling I am
35:34 reacting this is my reaction this I mind
35:37 this is upad tremendous amount of
35:40 attachment to these five Aggregates and
35:42 because of this tremendous amount of
35:44 attachment these five Aggregates keep on
35:46 arising multiplying multiplying the
35:48 shankaras keep on multiplying your
35:51 misery keeps on multiplying he could
35:53 understand that at the experiential
35:54 level this is where the trouble starts
35:57 so he examined the entire structure of
36:00 mind and matter at that level where all
36:02 these five he could see separately how
36:04 they are working and we person takes you
36:06 to the stage if you start playing games
36:08 with any kind of special sensation this
36:11 or that then you will forget dividing it
36:13 dissecting it understanding its nature
36:16 how the mind and matter get interaction
36:18 how they are influencing one one another
36:21 how they get influenced by the one
36:23 another all that will become unimportant
36:25 for you and you will be just elated when
36:27 you get a pleasant sensation and you
36:29 will get very much depressed when you
36:30 have unpleasant
36:32 sensation he took us to VD to the
36:34 sensation not to play the games of
36:37 sensation the aim was to come out of
36:40 these sensual objects and not to
36:42 generate craving and a verion which was
36:44 the teaching of all the spiritual
36:46 leaders but they were working only at
36:48 that level at the surface level at the
36:50 apparent level don't get indulged in
36:53 this sensual object or that sensual
36:54 object Buddha went deeper he said is our
36:58 craving and our our avorion does not
37:00 arise to these external objects the
37:03 external object and your craving and
37:06 your aversion there is something missing
37:08 in between and that Missing Link is the
37:11 sensation on the
37:12 body any object when it comes in
37:17 contact it comes in contact and there is
37:19 a
37:20 sensation and one part of the Mind gives
37:23 evaluation very good very bad it becomes
37:25 Pleasant it becomes unpleasant then only
37:30 V then only the craving or aversion
37:33 starts not before that and if this
37:35 particular link is missing then you keep
37:38 on working at the surface level it is
37:40 good you come out of craving an aversion
37:42 at the surface level of your mind the
37:44 intellect part of your mind becomes
37:46 purified nothing wrong but then you miss
37:48 the depth of your mind he took people to
37:51 go to the depth of the mind and work
37:53 with the Sensation that is why those who
37:56 want to practice vasana as Buddha taught
37:59 us those who want to practice in the
38:02 same way as vasana wants us to practice
38:05 they cannot forget with the V the
38:07 sensation on the body if you forget
38:09 sensation on the body and you are aware
38:11 of everything else outside it is good it
38:14 is good just to keep your mind
38:15 concentrated to keep the purity of your
38:18 mind at the surface level but you will
38:19 miss the root level of your mind with
38:22 sensation you are purifying your mind at
38:24 the root level so keep that in mind
38:26 whenever you PR V this sensation plays
38:30 such an important part the sensation
38:33 whether Pleasant or unpleasant you keep
38:35 on understanding its nature and with
38:37 practice and with experience how
38:40 unpleasant a sensation may be sooner
38:42 later you understand where look it arose
38:45 and after some time it passed away it is
38:47 not Eternal and when it turns into very
38:50 subtle vibration then also this wet
38:52 arising passing arising passing oh this
38:55 is impermanent this is the nature nature
38:57 of every sensation because this is the
38:59 nature of the entire physical structure
39:01 this is the nature of the entire mental
39:03 structure and a sensation is nothing but
39:05 a product of the Conta of these two so
39:07 when that arises as the object of the
39:11 sensation the mind and the body they
39:12 keep arising and passing away so the
39:14 sensation arises passes away and you are
39:16 experiencing it you're not playing
39:18 intellectual game you're not just
39:20 accepting it because Buddha said so and
39:22 as you keep on experiencing it
39:23 experiencing it becomes B may you're
39:26 living now you're experiencing it it is
39:29 not just Su it is not just a theory for
39:32 you at the Practical level you're
39:35 understanding and you started changing
39:37 the Habit pattern of your mind at the
39:39 depth level if this is understood and
39:42 kept in mind not that all the time you
39:44 will be so perfect that whenever
39:46 sensation comes you won't react at all
39:48 that's a very high stage but ultimately
39:51 want us to reach that state the aim
39:52 should be very clear any sensation I
39:56 will not react with craving or with
39:59 abortion even if I have reacted I will
40:02 come to senses as quickly as possible
40:04 very pleasant sensation came and you
40:05 started reacting ah wonderful this is
40:07 very good I got a flu now I got a flu
40:10 immediately you must come to senses oh
40:12 after all this is impermanent what
40:14 craving about it what and suddenly it
40:17 changes into very unpleasant sensation
40:19 and you react with a version how quickly
40:21 you come back to the wisdom oh no this
40:23 also is impermanent no ation no ation
40:26 like this you learn yourself to get
40:28 established in this anicha the wisdom of
40:31 anicha and you are progressing you are
40:34 progressing these are the basic
40:36 fundamental principles of Vash if you
40:39 don't miss them certainly the results
40:42 the whole technique is result oriented
40:45 not that you will get benefit after
40:47 death after that certainly benefits will
40:49 come there is no doubt because there's a
40:50 flow coming from the past and moving
40:53 towards the future taking us to the
40:55 final goal where the flow stops but
40:58 meanwhile when the flow is there
41:00 benefits benefits continue to be
41:01 benefits provided you practice in a
41:04 proper way this benefit must come here
41:06 and now in this very life if it is not
41:08 coming there is something wrong if there
41:10 is no change for better in your life
41:12 then there is something wrong something
41:14 wrong means you're not practicing
41:16 properly the technique is helpful it has
41:18 been helpful last 25 centuries to so
41:20 many people it is helping now so there
41:23 is no doubt about the technique but the
41:26 way in which one is practicing something
41:27 may be wrong so contact your teacher
41:29 your assistant teacher your guide and
41:32 try to understand what is wrong why I'm
41:33 not getting any benefit from it why my
41:36 anger has not diminished my passion has
41:38 not diminished my ego has not diminished
41:41 my impurities are not diminishing and
41:42 there is something wrong somewhere keep
41:45 on examining yourself don't expect magic
41:48 or Miracle that having one 10day course
41:50 now you're are free from craving free
41:51 from vertion it doesn't happen if it
41:53 happens I congratulate very good but it
41:56 takes time it's a long path quite a long
41:59 path if you understand how you to walk
42:01 on the path and if you are walking on
42:03 the right direction in the right way the
42:06 results good results are bound to come
42:09 bound to
42:10 come I feel myself very fortunate very
42:13 fortunate that I came in contact with DH
42:17 this
42:18 path very fortunate that I was born in
42:22 Burma the land of
42:24 T India lost this technique
42:28 after Buddha for about 5 centuries this
42:31 technique helped the people of India so
42:34 much but then slowly some wested
42:37 interest because of some ignorance
42:40 people started polluting the technique
42:42 tried to mix this try to mix
42:44 that and when you start mixing up the
42:48 technique you make it polluted then it
42:51 loses its efficacy you don't get the
42:53 result which you should get and when
42:55 people don't get the result they stop
42:57 practicing so like that India lost this
43:00 technique it went to different countries
43:02 and there also it got lost but one
43:04 neighboring country
43:06 Burma fortunately maintained the
43:09 technique in its pristine Purity
43:12 although with few people not that every
43:14 generation all the masses of the
43:17 population were practicing it no from
43:19 teacher to pupil from teacher to pupil
43:22 they took it their responsibility that
43:23 we got it from India we got it from
43:25 Buddha and we have to maintain in its
43:27 Christian Purity because after 2,500
43:30 years again it has to spread this was
43:32 the belief going on there so they kept
43:34 it in its pris Purity for their benefit
43:36 and for the future
43:38 Generations I feel myself very fortunate
43:40 that I was born there and came in
43:42 contact with this
43:44 technique 300 years after
43:48 Buddha during the time of Buddha and
43:50 during 300 years after Buddha this
43:53 technique spread in Northern parts of
43:55 India the after 300 years there came an
43:59 emperor a king an emperor by the name of
44:02 ashuka and a very cruel person very
44:06 ambitious person wanted more and more of
44:09 his Empire to spread his Empire he don't
44:11 mind killing people Ming people harming
44:13 people just out of this greed to have
44:16 bigger Empire and he was feeling very
44:19 proud to call himself Chand as as the
44:22 cruel he was very happy to say that
44:25 people getting frightened by his name
44:27 how this person because of some good
44:29 paries of the past he came in contact
44:31 with dma and he got totally changed by
44:35 practicing D realized harming people and
44:38 getting more and more wealth and more
44:39 and more power how is that going to help
44:41 me I'm harming myself I'm harming so
44:43 many people he became totally changed
44:46 and then people started calling him
44:48 dhoka one who was chandoka Ashoka the
44:51 cruel now become dhma Ashoka Ashoka the
44:55 master of dhama who was now now
44:57 developed in D full of love full of
45:00 compassion he started serving people
45:04 because once One Taste dhama one cannot
45:06 resist one feels like giving it to
45:08 others more and more people all this
45:10 population the people my subject they
45:13 are like my own children as I want my
45:15 children to develop in DH and come out
45:17 of their misery I like the entire
45:19 population of my country to take dhma
45:22 and come out of their misery he started
45:24 spreading with all the love with all the
45:25 compassion giving a good example as to
45:27 how he has changed others should also
45:29 change and not only Northern India
45:32 nearly whole of India started practicing
45:35 he trained teachers large number of
45:38 teachers who went around every part of
45:41 India and started teaching it and then
45:44 he thought why only India Mis is there
45:46 around the world everywhere so why not
45:48 to the other countries and he sent to
45:49 different countries from in the west up
45:52 to Europe and the whole of
45:55 Asia he he sent his
45:57 he called dhad ambassadors of dhama to
46:00 teach teach dama to teach
46:02 vas fortunately two of them who were
46:05 Aran fully liberated they were sent to
46:08 BMA by the name of Sona and utara and
46:12 these people took the words of Buddha
46:15 and the technique both and since then
46:18 from generation to generation from
46:19 generation to generation this wonderful
46:22 dhma was maintained in its pris Purity
46:25 the words of Buddha were also maintained
46:27 and also the technique was maintained in
46:28 the pristine Purity it went to different
46:31 other countries also like Lanka Sri
46:33 Lanka Cambodia Laos Thailand Etc there
46:37 also the words was maintained but the
46:39 technique got lost but in BMA they
46:42 maintained the technique also I'm very
46:44 fortunate that I was born in this land
46:46 land of dhama where dhama is still
46:49 there and again I feel myself very
46:52 fortunate that uh I was born in a
46:56 business family
46:58 fortunate because if I had been not born
47:01 in a business family in a rich family
47:03 and if I had not earned a lot of money
47:06 then perhaps some part of the mind would
47:07 have been thinking these rich people
47:09 they live a happy life and I missing it
47:12 these rich people now because I have
47:13 passed through that game and I know how
47:16 miserable these people are how miserable
47:19 this rat race of only making money
47:21 making money nothing but money money
47:23 money makes them so miserable I pass
47:25 through that misery I'm fortunate that I
47:27 passed through that
47:29 misery at a very young age started this
47:32 rat race of earning money money money
47:34 money and earn lot of money from the
47:36 burmish standard was a quite a rich man
47:39 quite successful in business and
47:42 industry and when somebody earns money
47:44 he gets a special position in the
47:46 society they make him Treasurer or
47:49 president or Secretary of this religious
47:51 organization their social welfare
47:53 organization about a score of different
47:56 organization ations president secretary
47:58 president secretary director trustee
48:01 another Madness it goes to the Head the
48:04 ego gets inflated look I'm such an
48:06 important person and all that in a very
48:08 young
48:09 age mid 20s or so and that made so
48:14 Madness and this created so much tension
48:17 inside again I feel very fortunate that
48:19 I passed through all that
48:21 difficulties I developed a kind of very
48:25 severe headache migrain headache a
48:26 special kind of migraine headache and
48:29 there was no treatment the best doctors
48:31 in Burma they tried to treat me
48:34 different kind of medicines nothing
48:37 could help they started giving me
48:39 morphine injection every fourth night
48:41 there will be very severe attack and
48:43 they have no treatment they gave Morphin
48:45 injection it went on for about four 5
48:46 years then these very doctors good
48:49 doctors they started saying me that
48:51 slowly you will become morphia addict
48:53 now you take morphia for the sake of
48:55 migraine and later on you will have to
48:57 take morphia for the sake of morphia
48:59 every day you will have to take morphia
49:00 what kind of life will be if want has to
49:02 take morphia every day so they said you
49:04 keep running to foreign countries for
49:06 your business forget business one trip
49:09 you go only to come out of morphia we
49:11 know no doctors have got treatment for
49:13 this migraine special kind of migraine
49:15 that you are suffering but certainly
49:17 they will have some other painkiller so
49:19 why not try accepting their advice I
49:22 went out stayed long time in Switzerland
49:26 in Germany in England in America and in
49:30 Japan where I had my own office so still
49:32 longer time and the best doctors
49:34 everywhere spent so much of money so
49:36 much of time again I find myself very
49:39 fortunate no doctor could treat me the
49:42 best doctors of the world they could not
49:44 treat me they could not take me out of
49:46 Mor even myig grain is far away very
49:49 fortunate I came back very disappointed
49:53 but ultimately it proved very fortunate
49:55 a friend of mine who later on became
49:58 Justice of the Supreme Court of BMA very
50:00 close friend he said you tried
50:03 everywhere why not try 10 days 10 days
50:06 with this uh teacher
50:09 of your disease looks like psychosomatic
50:13 disease and here is a technique given by
50:15 Buddha which will C purify your mind and
50:18 Once the mind gets purified the
50:19 psychosomatic disease goes away why
50:21 don't try I said wonderful if this can
50:24 help I went to my teacher
50:27 a very compassionate person
50:30 sakin and I said I want to join this one
50:33 of your 10day course he said welcome he
50:35 knew that I am leader of the Hindu
50:37 community and this is a Buddhist path it
50:39 doesn't matter don't get frightened
50:41 anybody Hindu Muslim Christian Jane all
50:43 can get the same benefit if you are a
50:45 Hindu you remain Hindu I'm not here to
50:47 convert you but you try this it's a good
50:50 technique and then I said that I have
50:52 come here because of this migraine
50:54 disease and then he sudden said no I I
50:56 won't take you I won't take you what
50:59 happened you are devaluing
51:01 d d is such a high spiritual PA it is to
51:05 take you out of all the miseries of Life
51:07 After Life and you want to make you just
51:09 for your your migraine headache no no
51:12 for that you go to some doctor go to
51:14 some hospital this is not the place and
51:17 then very very compassionately he
51:18 explains
51:20 me if you practice this technique this
51:23 will purify your mind the source of your
51:26 Miser is impurity in the mind when that
51:28 goes
51:29 away all psychosomatic diseases are like
51:32 byproduct you will get the benefit and
51:34 then he explains me you want to
51:36 establish a Sugar Factory for what
51:38 purpose to get sugar out of that factory
51:41 not molasses molases will come as a
51:43 byproduct nobody starts a Sugar Factory
51:46 to get molasses this is just a byproduct
51:48 so you don't come here just for your
51:50 migrant you come here for high spiritual
51:52 path then only it will help you I
51:55 understood because he was so kind kind
51:56 and so compassionate his vibrations are
51:59 so
52:00 wonderful yes I will join sir and I will
52:02 join only for spirituality not for this
52:05 migraine if it is not cured not Cur
52:07 don't care but going back home the
52:11 conditioning of the Mind from the very
52:13 childhood born in a very staunch
52:15 conservative Hindu family and although
52:19 we are taught from our childhood to have
52:21 respect towards Buddha Buddha is taken
52:23 as The Reincarnation of the god almighty
52:25 the Creator and he's the latest latest
52:28 model of that God n reincarnation so we
52:32 must have respect for him and all
52:33 regards for him but his teaching oh no
52:35 no no his teaching is not good because
52:38 he does not believe in Soul he does not
52:40 believe in God what kind of teaching
52:43 aist not good so this is what the
52:45 training was of the mind and that
52:47 started worrying if I go to these people
52:49 and learn this technique and if I become
52:52 Buddhist and if I have no faith in God
52:54 if I don't know faith in Soul what will
52:56 become I might go to hell oh no no no
52:58 this path is not for me I better not go
53:00 for a few months it went on some
53:02 struggle went on then later on I thought
53:05 my teacher says that you are a Hindu you
53:08 remain Hindu I'm not converting you to
53:10 Buddhism I make you a good human being
53:12 you practice Sheila morality you
53:14 practice Mastery of your mind you
53:15 practice PA purification of mind that is
53:19 acceptable with you also so why not try
53:21 all right I try but with a strong
53:23 determination that I will remain Hindu I
53:26 won't be a Buddhist all right I give a
53:28 trial for 10 days and I went
53:31 there very
53:33 fortunate of course like anybody else
53:35 the second day I thought like running
53:38 away because the conditioning of the
53:41 mind when I hear heard other people
53:43 saying that when they meditate they saw
53:46 this light or that light and I don't see
53:49 any light and my tradition says that if
53:51 you see Divine Light this is the stage
53:54 of Liberation and look these people are
53:56 seeing Divine Light and I not seen
53:57 Divine Light and then I remember the
53:59 word of another saintly person he
54:02 says a camel can pass through the eye of
54:05 a needle but a rich man cannot pass
54:08 through the Gateway of heaven and I am a
54:10 rich man so this path is for not for me
54:13 all these people they are teachers
54:15 professors doctors good people
54:16 good-hearted people they can see all the
54:19 Divine Light and all I can't see so why
54:21 waste my time here I better run away and
54:23 I
54:24 packed one of the Coit
54:27 professor of history of of the
54:29 University there she was very kind she
54:31 found out that I have pegged and I want
54:32 to run away so she tells me just one day
54:36 one day more the first day you started
54:38 getting so much sensation people get
54:40 only on the third day you get so much
54:41 and the teacher is so pleased with your
54:43 performance why you want to run away and
54:45 light is unimportant don't give
54:47 importance even if you feel light just
54:50 one day I feel so grateful to her she
54:52 kept me otherwise I would have missed
54:54 this wonderful path forever I stayed
54:57 there and that evening when I entered my
54:59 small little cell to meditate as I sat
55:01 down a light
55:03 came this light that light because the
55:06 mind was not craving now I am with my
55:08 sensation and suddenly a sound came and
55:11 with us the Divine sound oh this is
55:12 divine sound this is divine smell this
55:15 is Divine Light I said no my teacher
55:18 says don't give any importance only
55:19 sensation only sensation very fortunate
55:23 I passed through all that on the fifth
55:25 day or sixth day I was so fascinated by
55:29 the whole teaching because as a as a
55:31 leader of the Hindu Community I used to
55:34 give lectures on Gita I used to give
55:35 lectures on upanishad on vant and
55:38 everywhere the same teaching is there
55:40 come out of craving come out of ation
55:42 come out of anger come out of this come
55:45 out of that but how to come out there's
55:47 no technique mere sermons sermons
55:50 sermons and here I find this is applied
55:52 Gita this is applied vant here you got
55:55 the practice wonderful technique which
55:58 helps me to come out of my craving I
56:00 could not come out of my craving my fear
56:02 my ego my anger and here is something
56:06 which gives a practical path how to come
56:08 out of it I got so fascinated and after
56:11 10 days I found yes some change has
56:13 started coming in the Life some change
56:15 has started coming in the life and I
56:17 started making use of it I feel very
56:19 fortunate very fortunate that I was born
56:21 in a country country BMA which maintains
56:25 this technique in his pristin Purity Al
56:27 with very few people and they maintain
56:29 the words of Buddha in the pristin
56:31 Purity the technique of Buddha in
56:33 pristin Purity and came in contact with
56:35 this saintly person with so much of
56:38 compassion he taught me
56:40 dhama for 14 years doing my taking my
56:44 responsibility as a
56:45 householder I kept on working on this
56:48 technique
56:49 also after 14 years it so happened my
56:53 parents had left BMA and they had gone
56:55 to India and my mother became very sick
56:58 some kind of psychic trouble she had and
57:01 I knew if she practices vasna she will
57:04 come out of it but in those days the
57:07 burmish government would not give a
57:08 passport to their Nationals to go
57:10 out I feel very grateful to the bmis
57:13 government they gave me a passport to go
57:15 out to India to teach vasna to my
57:18 mother and I am very grateful to the
57:20 India government they gave me visa to
57:21 stay longer and to teach technique to my
57:25 mother the first course was given within
57:28 a month of my arrival in
57:30 India Buddha said that you cannot pay
57:35 back the debt of gratitude of your
57:36 parents so difficult whole life you just
57:40 keep on serving your parents serving
57:42 your parent do nothing still you cannot
57:44 come out of the Deb the only way to come
57:47 out of the debt of the parents is If the
57:50 parents are not established in Sheila
57:52 help them to get established in Sheila
57:54 if they are established in Sheila they
57:56 sadii help them to get establish in
57:58 samadi if they are establishing Sheila
58:00 and samadi and no PA help them to get
58:02 establish in PA they have Sheila samadi
58:05 and Pa and they not realized the
58:06 ultimate goal of nib help them I feel
58:10 very fortunate that I could come out of
58:12 the debt of gratitude of my parents it
58:15 was a small course my two parents
58:18 participated and 12 others participated
58:21 some known some unknown I had come to
58:23 India just for 3 months to give this T
58:25 to my parents especially my mother and
58:28 then these 12 people when they passed
58:30 through the course they started pressing
58:32 hard one more course please one more
58:34 course my father will participate my
58:36 wife or my husband or my son or my
58:39 daughter this is the quality of dma come
58:41 and see come and see so another course
58:44 and then another course and then another
58:45 course don't know when that 3mon period
58:47 passed away and then month after month
58:49 year after year and course after course
58:51 course after course the genes of dhama
58:54 started flowing in the country of its or
58:57 when I was in
58:59 Burma many people there had a belief and
59:02 my teacher had a very strong
59:04 belief it seems when this wonderful
59:08 dhama was sent to BMA by Ashoka these
59:11 two AR hanss who were sent there
59:13 liberated Souls when they were sent
59:15 there Sona and utara their teacher told
59:19 them that you are taking this Jewel of
59:21 dhma to a country which will maintain it
59:24 in its pristin purity for the coming
59:27 centuries it will be forgotten
59:29 everywhere but this technique will
59:31 remain in that country the name of the
59:33 country in those days was suomi the land
59:35 of gold golden land the golden land can
59:38 keep this gem after 2,500 years after
59:43 passing away of Buddha it will again
59:45 come to India get established there and
59:47 then spread around the world my teacher
59:49 used to say now 2,500 year and I don't
59:53 know maybe some accident it was that
59:55 year when I got my D 2,500 year was
59:58 ending in the next first year of the
1:00:01 next next SAS the Revival of dama that
1:00:04 was the time when I got D he says now
1:00:06 the clock of V Struck it has to spread
1:00:09 it has to
1:00:11 spread to be true at that time to me it
1:00:14 looked like a sectarian belief why 2,500
1:00:17 why not 2,400 why not 2,600 why 2,500
1:00:21 what the reason behind it didn't look
1:00:22 very scientific but this was the belief
1:00:26 but when I
1:00:27 came I was really W struck when I saw
1:00:30 what is happening when I came to India I
1:00:33 made a list of people who knew me or
1:00:35 whom I knew the list could not come to
1:00:37 three figures it was less than 100 less
1:00:39 than 100 in a country of millions L less
1:00:43 than 100 people know me or I know them
1:00:46 how in the courses people started coming
1:00:48 Unknown People and from every sect from
1:00:51 every
1:00:52 Community unbelievable and not only
1:00:55 ordinary the people householders heads
1:00:57 of the community heads of the sick the
1:01:01 monks Buddhist monks the Hindu sasis the
1:01:05 Jane monks and nuns thousands hundreds
1:01:08 thousands the Christian monks priests
1:01:11 nuns hundreds thousands in all total how
1:01:14 they are coming how they are coming a
1:01:16 large number of people from different
1:01:18 walks of life how they are
1:01:20 coming what miracle I don't know them
1:01:23 they don't know me how people get
1:01:24 attracted to Dharma and then slowly it
1:01:27 became clearer and clearer people come
1:01:30 to the
1:01:30 courses and when I come in contact with
1:01:33 them many of them when I see them meet
1:01:37 them discuss with them talk with them
1:01:38 something starts inside feeling that
1:01:41 this person is known to me known to me
1:01:43 from long time this person is known to
1:01:45 me known to yes known to me so many
1:01:48 lives this person must have been
1:01:50 meditating with me in Vash now the time
1:01:52 has come this person already has got
1:01:54 seed of vasana seed of dhama and now the
1:01:57 time is ripened for this person to grow
1:01:59 grow in dhama and not only help oneself
1:02:02 but help others there is a potentiality
1:02:04 of this person not only to help oneself
1:02:06 but help others also and I also see
1:02:09 there are people who have come just to
1:02:11 take the seed of T they have done some
1:02:14 very good karma of the past some very
1:02:16 wholesome deed they have done and the
1:02:19 ripening of that deed has helped them to
1:02:21 get a seed of T so whether you belong to
1:02:24 the category where you got the seed of D
1:02:26 or whether you belong to the category
1:02:28 where you already had a seed of dhama
1:02:30 and now you come to develop in
1:02:32 dhama the wonderful Jewel that you have
1:02:34 got make use of it properly don't just
1:02:38 throw it away I have seen one big defect
1:02:41 in some students and I keep on warning
1:02:43 them many time people come just to give
1:02:47 a trial nothing wrong something new when
1:02:49 should first give a trial but you keep
1:02:52 on giving trial only trial and you never
1:02:55 become serious to
1:02:57 I see people coming to
1:02:59 India and they will go for this
1:03:02 particular this particular experience of
1:03:04 that particular
1:03:06 experience have grass experience or have
1:03:09 some chemical experience and then they
1:03:12 go to some gurus this Baba experience
1:03:14 this Guru experience and similarly they
1:03:16 come toaa experience AA trip we had all
1:03:19 those trips now going C
1:03:22 trip what you g all right have you going
1:03:24 C trip have one have two have three but
1:03:27 ultimately make a decision if you find
1:03:30 that some other technique is good for
1:03:31 you work on that seriously and and get
1:03:34 benefit from it little bit here little
1:03:36 bit there whole life you're wasting your
1:03:38 life is a very serious path it is not
1:03:41 just a mental entertainment or
1:03:43 intellectual entertainment or emotional
1:03:46 entertainment like somebody's thirsty
1:03:48 and wants Water started digging a well
1:03:50 you dig a well about 10 ft and then
1:03:53 somebody says no no no their water is
1:03:54 better and you start Di there 10 ft 10
1:03:57 ft here 10 ft here whole life you keep
1:03:58 on diing 10t 10 ft you won't get water
1:04:00 at all so have one or two trials doesn't
1:04:03 matter but then make a decision I must
1:04:05 go to the depth where I get my water so
1:04:07 make trials and then make a decision
1:04:10 that if this path is suitable to you you
1:04:13 find that this looks very logical
1:04:15 pragmatic scientific is not any kind of
1:04:18 guram is involved and no any kind of
1:04:20 Dogma is involved no belief is involved
1:04:22 this is just pure science of mind and
1:04:24 matter and it has helped me it gives
1:04:26 good good result then work on it work on
1:04:29 it to me I'm very sure it's a jewel
1:04:33 invaluable Jewel nothing like this one
1:04:36 can get in life fortunately you got it
1:04:39 now make use of it make use of it for
1:04:42 your own good and make use of it for the
1:04:44 good of so many others dhma is a
1:04:47 wonderful
1:04:48 Jewel one can come out of all the
1:04:51 miseries of the life all the miseries of
1:04:53 the life may all of you who are
