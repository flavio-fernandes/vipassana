0:07 the fourth day is
0:12 over you have now six more left to
0:19 work the fourth
0:23 day a very important
0:27 day very important day indeed in the
0:33 sense that you
0:37 started the real practice of
0:43 today the previous 3 days we just making
0:50 preparation to enter the field of V the
0:53 field of
0:57 P all the remaining 6 days are very
1:03 important because working seriously
1:07 diligently you will get established in
1:10 this
1:13 technique which has its own
1:20 peculiarity there are many techniques of
1:26 meditation this is quite peculiar
1:35 one can start
1:38 meditating by contemplating
1:41 something a part of the
1:44 scriptures words of some sages or Saints
1:48 you keep on contemplating
1:50 contemplating your mind gets
1:53 concentrated
1:56 good it helps you
2:01 or you start verbalizing some
2:04 name some word again and again mentally
2:08 your mind gets concentrated it helps
2:12 you or you start visualizing and
2:15 imaginary shape or form of this God God
2:19 or that
2:21 goddess this saintly person or that
2:23 saintly
2:25 person and repeatedly you imagine you
2:28 imagine your mind gets
2:31 concentrated
2:33 good it
2:39 helps when you get your mind
2:47 concentrated you will find that a change
2:50 has started at the surface level of the
2:54 Mind
2:57 provided the motivation of concentration
3:00 is not un
3:03 wholesome but the change is just at the
3:05 surface level of the
3:08 Mind in very deep absorption
3:12 sadis it may penetrate a
3:16 little but it can't reach the depth of
3:19 the
3:24 mind what you call in the western
3:27 psychology
3:30 the conscious mind the surface of the
3:32 mind
3:34 works when you meditate with
3:37 verbalization
3:40 visualization
3:45 imagination it does not touch the depth
3:48 of the
3:51 mind and all our problems
3:55 lie in the depth of the
3:58 mind at the root
4:02 level our defilements have their Roots
4:06 deep
4:07 inside this is the
4:11 storehouse and it is so
4:16 fertile you may cut a
4:19 particular
4:23 defilement from the top level you may
4:27 cut even the trunk but the root
4:31 remains and so long as the root remains
4:33 it can Sprout again it will Sprout again
4:37 and will again
4:38 grow you are not liberated from
4:43 this this was the
4:46 Enlightenment of
4:48 K he became enlightened he became budha
4:52 because he realized
4:54 that unless you take the roots out roots
4:58 of your imper ities if they are not
5:01 taken out totally you are not
5:04 liberated and he found out a
5:08 way he worked on
5:11 this got
5:14 liberated and then with all the
5:16 compassion Love Good Will started
5:18 Distributing
5:19 it we are
5:23 fortunate we have the same technique
5:25 with
5:26 us and you have taken today most of you
5:30 the first
5:32 step on the path of a
5:35 p most of you for the first
5:39 time you taken a dip in the GES of dhama
5:44 within in the GES of
5:48 reality otherwise from the time one has
5:51 taken birth open eyes started seeing
5:55 things outside outside
5:57 outside all the time the outside objects
6:00 have become so predominant for you you
6:03 never care to know what's happening
6:06 inside even if you try to meditate with
6:09 closed eyes you work with the objects
6:12 outside which you read which you have
6:15 heard which you have seen and you
6:18 contemplate all
6:20 that you never try to observe the
6:24 reality as it
6:27 is and the reality as it is within the
6:30 framework of the body is constantly
6:35 changing there is no stationary object
6:38 on which you can keep your attention
6:42 fixed and this is very helpful to know
6:45 that everything is changing and you are
6:47 aware of it within the framework of the
6:51 body this is what he called in the
6:54 language of those days n
6:59 sa sa is awareness your awareness should
7:04 be nich all the
7:07 time within the framework of the
7:12 body and you started learning how to
7:15 keep your attention within the framework
7:18 of the body with the reality that
7:20 manifests from moment to moment from
7:23 moment to
7:25 mov later on as you develop the
7:28 technique you you become more and more
7:30 established in the
7:32 technique then in your daily life also
7:35 whatever you
7:36 do you don't lose the contact of the
7:39 reality inside and you find your mind
7:41 remains very balanced in every situation
7:45 remains very balanced now at this stage
7:48 you have to learn how to be aware of the
7:50 reality within the framework of the body
7:53 at the experiential level
8:00 in the language of budha language of
8:03 those days of
8:05 India the word v was
8:09 used and V means
8:12 experience a feeling a
8:15 sensation you're not just contemplating
8:17 you are not just imagining you not just
8:24 intellectualizing you're just feeling
8:26 actual feeling you really experiencing
8:29 it
8:30 and that was
8:31 V and this is what you started doing
8:34 feeling the reality from head to feet
8:37 from head to
8:39 feet this
8:42 base should not be lost you to maintain
8:46 the awareness of the feeling with
8:47 feeling within the framework of the
8:52 body now questions
8:54 arise about the
8:57 technique you have taken the first
9:01 step some questions might arise in your
9:03 mind also there are common questions
9:06 which come in the mind of the students
9:09 let us deal with them
9:11 now one question that keeps coming
9:15 is why move from head to
9:19 feet why move even immobile I can feel
9:23 things happening here here here then why
9:26 move
9:29 it is said to be a choiceless
9:31 observation a forless
9:33 observation let things happen and I will
9:37 observe why make even this effort to
9:40 move good question but understand why
9:43 you
9:44 move not to satisfy a particular
9:47 tradition it has its own
9:54 purpose if you don't
9:56 move then you feel a very strong int
9:59 sensation somewhere your attention goes
10:01 there suddenly something else starts
10:04 somewhere else your attention goes there
10:07 you will be moving from part to part
10:09 where you get cross intensified
10:11 solidified
10:14 Sensations most
10:16 parts will be left out you will never
10:20 feel you will never observe and the
10:22 subtler sensations that are prevailing
10:24 on those
10:26 parts you will miss
10:28 them your mind will remain very
10:31 gross the ability of your mind will be
10:34 to feel only gross Sensations you are
10:37 not training your mind to feel the
10:38 subtler ones which are there on other
10:41 parts of the body because you always
10:44 work with the intense sensation this
10:46 intense sensation or that intense
10:48 sensation moving is very
10:54 important one reason is that when you
10:57 proceed on the path there are are
10:59 important stations and one has to pass
11:02 through those stations one of the
11:05 station and important station is that
11:08 you must reach the stage where you feel
11:11 Sensations everywhere on the
11:13 body every part of the body there is a
11:18 sensation every particle of the body has
11:21 a sensation every
11:23 moment so long as there is life wherever
11:26 there is a life there is a sensation
11:30 you have to develop the sensitivity of
11:33 your mind the sharpness of your mind if
11:36 that is missing you won't be able to
11:38 feel Sensations everywhere you will miss
11:41 this this important station for that
11:44 purpose you have to
11:48 move then the question comes if you have
11:50 to move all right you
11:52 move then why in a
11:56 order and why in this particular order
12:00 this particular order is not necessary
12:03 if this order does not suit you and some
12:06 other order suits you go ahead any order
12:10 but maintain that
12:12 order Because unless you move in order
12:15 again and again the same order you don't
12:18 know you might be missing certain parts
12:20 and as I said we don't want you to miss
12:22 any part of the body mov in order very
12:27 important another question a practical
12:30 question comes while you are moving in
12:34 order you reached a certain part and
12:37 suddenly an intense sensation starts on
12:39 area which you left
12:41 already or a sensation starts on area
12:44 where you not yet
12:46 reached shall I make a jump and go there
12:49 oh no never do that then again you will
12:53 be running from one intense sensation to
12:55 another intense Sensation from one part
12:57 of the body to another part of the body
12:59 not in order and you'll be missing many
13:03 parts of the body and you'll be missing
13:05 the subtler sensations you cannot train
13:09 your mind to feel very subtle Sensations
13:11 which is very important part of the
13:15 technique I've
13:17 seen people working at random gross
13:21 Sensations cross Sensations for years
13:24 together they don't reach the stage
13:27 where they can feel all kinds of
13:29 Sensations especially the subtler
13:31 sensations the subtler reality
13:34 is that the entire physical structure is
13:38 made up of kapas tiny little atomic
13:42 particles and every atomic particle is
13:45 nothing but wavelet wavelet so the
13:47 entire physical structure is not nothing
13:49 but wavelet wavelet vibration vibration
13:55 vibration a modern scientist also says
13:58 so modern science says so there is no
14:00 solidity in the material world all
14:03 wavelets wavelets
14:06 wavelets the same thing a Buddha
14:10 said there's
14:12 combustion and vibration entire universe
14:16 combusion vibration he's experiencing
14:20 and he puts in word his own
14:25 experience the scientist understands it
14:28 at the intellectual level we are not
14:29 against the modern science or modern
14:31 scientist they have done they have
14:33 played their own part to serve the
14:35 humanity but if you want to understand
14:38 the law of nature at the deeper
14:41 level you must have direct experience of
14:44 the nature of the law the law of the
14:47 nature and that can be done only when
14:50 you feel the totality of whatever is
14:54 happening within the framework of the
14:55 body just working with the gross intense
14:58 Sensations you can't understand the law
15:00 of nature at the deeper level therefore
15:03 it is
15:04 essential that you go in
15:07 order you reached a certain place and
15:09 some sensation very intense started in
15:12 the area which you left
15:13 already a part of your mind will be KN
15:16 it but still keep moving and the next
15:18 round when you reach there and if it is
15:20 still there observe it if it is gone it
15:22 is gone keep on moving in order in order
15:29 another
15:30 question that keeps
15:33 coming how long one should
15:36 take how long one should take to move
15:39 from head to
15:41 feet there is no fixed time for that
15:45 it's a middle
15:46 path neither you should at this stage
15:49 neither you should speed up so much that
15:54 in one breath you are from head to feet
15:56 and you miss so many things
15:59 no should go so slow that pinpoint
16:02 pinpoint pinpoint takes hours together
16:05 and your mind will get bored and you
16:06 can't work so say about 10 minutes to
16:10 make one round is good enough little
16:12 long also doesn't
16:15 matter how much area at a time initially
16:19 as you start working 2 3 in 2 3 in 2 3
16:24 in good
16:25 enough but sometimes somebody's mind is
16:28 very dull
16:29 or
16:31 even somebody's mind is very sharp and
16:33 at times it becomes very dull and you
16:36 can't feel anything mind is so
16:39 gross Sensations are so subtle you can't
16:42 feel then take big chunks the whole head
16:46 the whole face the whole chest the whole
16:49 abdomen move big areas you get one
16:52 sensation somewhere good move and keep
16:54 moving keep moving keep moving and you
16:56 will find slowly you get Sensations
16:58 everywhere you will reach a stage where
17:00 you get sensation all around the tiniest
17:03 spot you will get sensation you have to
17:05 work very patiently very
17:09 patiently another question that keeps
17:13 coming shall we feel the sensations just
17:15 on the surface of the
17:17 body or also
17:20 inside at this stage when you started
17:23 working on this technique better first
17:25 work on the surface
17:29 Within These 10 days most of you might
17:32 reach the
17:34 stage where you'll be able to penetrate
17:37 and go deeper inside piercingly
17:39 penetratingly and you will feel
17:40 Sensations everywhere Outside Inside
17:43 Outside Inside but not
17:46 now first let
17:49 your mind be strong enough sharp enough
17:53 to feel the reality at the surface
17:56 level of course in some cases
17:59 it just happens naturally a student
18:02 comes and reports that I started feeling
18:04 something inside nothing
18:06 wrong if naturally something happens it
18:08 happens but intentionally you to work on
18:12 the surface of the body at this
18:17 stage one point should be very
18:21 clear as to what the sensation
18:26 is the word sensation
18:29 if it is not clear in your
18:31 mind you may be just looking for
18:37 something and will remain
18:40 confused it is so simple understand it I
18:43 keep on repeating
18:46 sensation is whatever you experience at
18:49 the physical
18:50 level at the bodily level whatever you
18:53 feel it is a
18:55 sensation you feel heat heat is a
18:57 sensation you feel perspiration
18:59 perspiration
19:00 sensation you feel throbbing you feel
19:03 pulsation vibration tingling sensation
19:06 heaviness numbness anything that you
19:08 feel at the physical level is a
19:13 sensation difficulty comes
19:16 sometimes but in spite of such repeated
19:21 explanations one does not want to
19:23 understand what it
19:25 is and one keeps on looking for
19:27 something
19:33 many times we come across
19:36 cases where someone says no I don't get
19:39 any
19:40 sensation like tomorrow your assistant
19:42 teachers will examine you and they will
19:45 question you any
19:48 sensation and one amongst you might say
19:51 no no sensation no sensation and the
19:54 second question he or she will ask could
19:57 you sit for 1 hour without changing your
19:59 posture oh no I had to change so many
20:02 times why there was so severe pain
20:06 severe pain and yet no
20:10 sensation there cannot be a more intense
20:12 sensation than
20:14 pain and you said no
20:17 sensation because you are looking for
20:19 something you're looking for something
20:21 special a sensation of Blaze ecstasy ah
20:25 wonderful I came for meditation to
20:28 experience Bliss what this
20:30 pain am I here to observe the pain I
20:33 didn't come for pain pain I already had
20:35 in my life why I come here for
20:39 pain they looking for something very
20:43 difficult it happens even during
20:46 anaana on the second day or third day
20:48 when you are asked any sensation in this
20:52 area and someone replies no no
20:56 sensation hey what is this this was just
20:59 some itching here itching is no
21:01 sensation for this person looking for
21:05 something no
21:09 sensation and someone
21:12 comes once a while someone will come and
21:15 say oh go kaj I have lot of pain
21:19 pressure heaviness heat perspiration
21:22 throbbing everything what you say but no
21:26 sensation no sensation all these there
21:28 no sensation for him he's looking for
21:30 something
21:31 special I always remember the case of my
21:36 friend for the first time when I went to
21:38 a course like this decades

24:19 Center must have individual cells for
24:22 each indiv for each individual
24:24 meditators so there are cells and the
24:27 teacher will go
24:30 there to give guidance to the
24:32 students and when there are Indians who

24:36 take me to translate so we went to the
24:39 cell of this meditator my friend knocked

25:07 perspiration and he looks at me looks at
25:10 my teacher what we are talking to
25:13 observe heat I have come here to observe
25:15 heat to observe
25:18 perspiration what you talking as if
25:20 you're are
25:21 joking and we say well look this is the
25:24 technique you have to do that observe
25:26 you have been reacting to them now you
25:28 observe he won't
25:29 listen I have come here if you make me
25:34 witness this Soul then there is a
25:35 meaning witness the God then there some
25:38 meaning even witness Buddha his
25:40 incarnation of God Almighty there is
25:41 some
25:42 meaning no purpose otherwise what
25:45 purpose there is to observe this
25:48 heat and every day we try to explain and
25:52 every day when we question any sensation
25:54 nothing
25:55 special he's looking for something
25:57 special
25:58 nothing
26:00 special I felt so sorry with such
26:03 difficulty he came and all the 10 days
26:05 he kept on looking for something special
26:07 something special and nothing special
26:10 came the nature was manifesting itself
26:13 the nature of the body was manifesting
26:15 itself the truth was manifesting itself
26:17 the dama was manifesting itself and he
26:19 was kicking it no I don't want it I want
26:21 something special something
26:25 special after one year he saw so many
26:28 people going there and everyone goes
26:29 there comes out smiling this benefit
26:32 that benefit he felt very sorry he
26:34 missed something he understood so he
26:37 pressed once more please give me one
26:39 more chance the teacher will not take
26:40 but please recommend one more chance now
26:42 if you say to observe heat I will
26:44 observe heat only nothing else
26:45 perspiration I will observe perspiration
26:47 only nothing else and yet he came and he
26:50 worked properly and he developed so much
26:53 in vas so so long as you're looking for
26:56 something special you're not doing Vash
27:01 whatever has happened at this moment the
27:04 reality of this moment as it is as it is
27:07 not as you would like it to be if this
27:09 is understood you will keep on
27:12 progressing keep on progressing there
27:13 will be no
27:15 difficulty but if you keep on ignoring
27:17 the reality which is manifested and you
27:19 look for something which is not there
27:21 then you are not
27:22 doing so keep this point in mind that
27:25 whatever you feel at this
27:29 body level at the physical level
27:32 anything that you feel is a sensation
27:34 Pleasant or unpleasant Intense or Fe
27:37 whatever it is you just observe just
27:39 observe you done your
27:41 job and leave the rest to
27:44 D leave the rest to
27:47 Nature thy will you done your job and
27:51 the results will start
27:52 coming you're moving from head to feet
27:56 from head to feet you might reach stage
27:58 where you don't feel any sensation on
28:00 some part where there is no sensation
28:02 for you there is no sensation for you it
28:05 is a blind area a blank area actually
28:07 there is no blind area no blank area
28:09 sensation is there everywhere but
28:12 because your mind is very gross and the
28:15 prevailing sensation on that particular
28:17 part is very subtle so your mind is not
28:20 capable of feeling it so you say there
28:22 is no sensation all right no sensation
28:25 this is the reality of this moment no
28:26 sensation stay stay there stay there
28:30 calmly quietly
28:33 attentively and
28:35 equanimous very important
28:38 equanimous if you're not
28:40 equanimous then the technique will not
28:42 help you if there is no sensation a
28:44 blind area you are staying there for a
28:46 minute and you start craving oh I want a
28:48 sensation I want a sensation you stayed
28:52 one minute no sensation next round again
28:53 you come I want a sensation I want a
28:56 sensation no sensation or look for five
28:58 times no sensation 10 times no sensation
29:00 you're craving craving craving and
29:03 whenever you start craving you lose the
29:05 balance of your mind and when the Mind
29:07 loses the balance it becomes very gross
29:11 it can't feel the sensation which is
29:13 subtle therefore
29:15 equanimous even no craving you may have
29:18 aversion look this blindness has not yet
29:20 G away one round it has not gone away
29:23 five rounds it has not gone away and you
29:25 got aversion aversion towards this
29:27 blindness of the
29:28 again you lost the balance of the Mind
29:31 remain equanimous just accept the
29:34 reality as it is this is the moment when
29:37 I'm not experiencing any sensation in
29:39 this area I've done my
29:42 job no sensation no sensation let me see
29:45 what
29:46 happens but see if it is a covered part
29:50 of the body try to feel the touch of the
29:53 cloth this also the sensation although
29:55 very superficial doesn't matter touch of
29:57 the cloth and move if it is an open part
30:00 of the body uncovered part of the body
30:02 touch of the atmosphere very superficial
30:04 yeah touch of the atmosphere and move
30:07 and keep working like this very
30:08 patiently very patiently soon you will
30:11 reach the stage where you will start
30:12 feeling Sensations
30:15 everywhere two aspects of this technique
30:18 one is develop your
30:22 capability sensitivity of the mind to
30:25 feel Sensations everywhere of all
30:27 different types
30:29 and the second learn how to observe it
30:32 objectively
30:34 objectively try not to
30:37 react you are learning this technique to
30:40 change the Habit pattern of your mind at
30:43 the deepest
30:44 level the deepest level of the mind what
30:47 you call the unconscious mind actually
30:49 it is not unconscious every moment day
30:52 and night it is feeling the sensation on
30:55 the body it is experiencing sensation on
30:58 the body every type of sensation
31:00 whatever comes up from moment to moment
31:02 it keeps on feeling and it keeps on
31:05 reacting to them if the sensation is
31:07 Pleasant it will react with craving
31:09 clinging if the sensation is unpleasant
31:12 it will react with aversion hatred this
31:15 habit pattern of this deep unconscious
31:17 mind all the time craving hating craving
31:21 hating craving hating you to turn this
31:23 habit pattern and for that you to reach
31:26 the stage where the this habit pattern
31:28 is prevailing that means the deepest
31:31 level of the Mind where you feel
31:33 Sensations and you don't crave and you
31:35 don't hate you just observe and
31:38 understand look it is changing it is
31:40 changing it is
31:43 changing as you keep on working on it
31:47 keep on working on
31:49 it realities of nature will become
31:52 clearer and clearer the law of nature
31:56 will start revealing itself
31:59 the law is law everywhere Outside Inside
32:02 the entire universe is governed by the
32:04 same law animate in
32:06 animate you can try to understand this
32:09 law at the intellectual level when you
32:10 see things happening
32:12 outside but you cannot experience it you
32:16 can experience only when you feel things
32:19 within the framework of the body then
32:22 you are experiencing it and then it
32:24 becomes very clear there cannot be any
32:26 confusion there cannot be any out and
32:29 this is what he
32:32 did although born in a royal family a
32:38 prince it was peculiar the prince was
32:42 not born in a Royal Palace he was born
32:44 under a tree open Nature Open
32:49 sky at the age of about five or six it
32:52 so
32:53 happened he was sitting under a
32:55 tree and he just started medit
32:57 meditating observing respiration
33:00 respiration and went in very deep
33:02 samadhi deep absorption
33:04 samadhi under a tree open Nature the
33:08 first first taste of meditation the
33:12 samadi at the age of 35 he went out
33:16 again under a tree got fully
33:20 enlightened and then out of compassion
33:22 started Distributing this wonderful
33:24 technique to others and started rotating
33:27 the of D the first teaching he gave
33:31 again under a tree open Nature Open
33:36 Sky and at the ripened age of 80 he
33:40 passed away under a tree open Nature
33:43 Open Sky all the important events of his
33:46 life under a tree open Nature Open Sky
33:49 he studied the nature so
33:51 thoroughly but studying the nature so
33:54 thoroughly outside cannot make one a
33:56 Buddha one cannot become an enlightened
33:59 person it was studying the nature inside
34:03 at the experiential level which made him
34:05 a bu and this is what he
34:09 taught all the time you to be aware of
34:14 the reality within the framework of the
34:16 body and this
34:18 is and by this the entire law become so
34:22 clear so clear at the experiential level
34:26 one thing that becomes very clear
34:28 to a student of
34:30 is
34:32 change change every moment some change
34:36 or the other is taking
34:38 place within the framework of the body
34:40 you are experiencing it and outside also
34:43 the same law changing changing
34:46 constantly changing constantly
34:49 changing as if everything is in a
34:51 Melting
34:53 Pot everything is in a melting po
34:56 nothing has come out as the final
34:57 product now no more change in it animate
35:00 or inanimate everything in a melting
35:02 part changing changing changing all in a
35:05 flux all in a flow that reality now
35:09 comes with the experience within the
35:11 framework of the
35:12 body another
35:15 reality whatever is happening A change
35:17 is taking
35:18 place whatever is happening is not
35:21 happening accidentally everything that
35:25 is happening has got some cause or the
35:27 other
35:28 one cause or number of causes together
35:30 and
35:31 results into a effect cause effect cause
35:36 effect and the effect becomes a cause
35:38 for something else effect cause cause
35:41 effect effect cause this is how the
35:44 entire universe keeps on rotating
35:47 rolling flowing cause effect effect
35:51 cause cause effect this becomes very
35:53 clear at the experiential level another
35:56 reality which will become very clear as
35:59 the cause is so the effect will be as
36:03 the cause is so the effect will be as
36:06 the seed is so the fruit will be outside
36:10 in the vegetation world we see the same
36:11 thing inside also one starts
36:14 experiencing the same law outside in the
36:18 world I plant two seeds one seed of
36:22 sugar cane another seed of NE a very
36:25 bitter Tree in tropical countries a NE
36:29 Tre same
36:30 soil same water same air same Sun they
36:35 get same
36:36 nutrition they sprouted out and started
36:39 growing what happened what happened to
36:42 the sugar cane plant every fiber of it
36:46 so sweet so sweet and this name tree
36:49 every fiber of it so bitter so
36:52 bitter why the nature is so kind to one
36:55 and so cruel to the other or you can say
36:58 the God Almighty why is so kind to one
37:00 so cruel to other no nobody is kind or
37:04 cruel this is just fixed law of nature
37:08 nature only gives nutrition and helps
37:11 the seed to manifest its quality the
37:14 quality of the sugar cane seed is
37:17 sweetness
37:19 sweetness it manifest itself in every
37:22 fiber the quality of the ne seed is
37:25 bitterness bitterness is Manifest in
37:27 every fiber law of nature law of
37:31 nature a big tree has
37:35 grown and I go
37:37 there pay respect three times make 108
37:42 rounds then offer flowers incense sweets
37:46 Etc and then with moist
37:49 eyes start praying oh NE God please give
37:53 me sweet mangoes I want sweet mangoes
37:56 please give me you keep on crying for
37:58 the whole year whole life nothing
38:00 happens you get only bitter name you
38:04 can't get sweet
38:07 mangoes if you really want sweet mangoes
38:11 then while planting the seed you must be
38:13 very careful you plant the seed of sweet
38:16 mango you will get nothing but sweet
38:17 mango our difficulty is that we keep on
38:20 planting while planting we are so
38:23 careless so unaware so unmindful keep on
38:26 planting bitter seeds bitter seeds when
38:29 the time of harvest comes fru comes a
38:31 then I want sweet fruits only sweet not
38:35 possible and expect that something will
38:38 happen for me in spite of my bitter seed
38:41 being planted by me I will get some
38:44 sweet fruits some invisible power will
38:47 help me the God Almighty will help me
38:50 why God Almighty will help you why not
38:53 others because you praise him you try to
38:58 Puff him and he becomes very happy
39:00 because of that and he will help you and
39:02 he won't help others Madness the earlier
39:06 one comes out of this
39:08 madness and earlier one starts following
39:11 the path of the law of nature as I have
39:14 planted the seeds that type of fruits
39:17 are bound to come therefore I must be
39:19 very careful while planting the seeds
39:21 while planting the seeds the earlier one
39:23 gets the path of Liberation otherwise
39:26 one keeps on rolling rolling rolling in
39:29 ignorance just keeps on fooling oneself
39:31 deceiving oneself and keeps on rolling
39:34 in misery one cannot come out of the
39:35 misery law of nature is law of nature
39:38 Universal applicable on everyone as the
39:41 seed is so the fruit will be as your
39:44 action is so the result will be what
39:49 kind of action that kind of result is
39:51 bound to
39:53 be one
39:55 incident at the time
39:59 Buddha one day very young man came

41:29 this Pawn nearby placed it with the
41:32 weight they went down to the
41:33 bottom bring a big stick and a strong
41:37 stick strike at them break them open
41:40 they were broken
41:41 open he was so happy buha is pering a
41:45 wonderful ritual for my
41:47 father India is aast land and a very
41:50 ancient land a land of diversities land
41:54 of extremes you find people reaching ing
41:57 the stage of full Enlightenment like
41:59 Buddha and you find people so ignorant
42:01 rolling in all these blind faiths and
42:03 beliefs and dogmas Etc now there is a
42:06 belief when the father or mother
42:09 dies the son will take the dead body and
42:12 put on the funeral fire and burn when it
42:14 is half burned he takes a big stick and
42:17 Strikes at the skull the skull is broken
42:20 and the belief here the skull is broken
42:22 and there the Gateway of heaven is
42:24 heaven is broken and one gets the entry
42:27 now because the father is already died
42:29 and his body was already burnt yesterday
42:32 now as a symbol he's making me break
42:35 these earn parts and he did that one
42:38 that contained butter that butter came
42:39 up and started floating on the surface
42:42 one that contained Pebbles it remained
42:44 at the bottom now Buddha said this much
42:46 I have done now call all your priests
42:49 let them come here and pray pray oh
42:52 Pebbles come up come up the surface come
42:55 upon the surface he butter you go down

43:00 it
43:00 happens what sir you started joking is
43:04 it possible this is not possible sir
43:07 this is against the law of nature the
43:09 Pebbles are heavier than water they are
43:10 bound to remain at the bottom they can't
43:12 float sir and the butter is lighter than
43:15 water it will keep on floating it can't
43:17 go down young man you know so much about
43:19 the law of Nature and yet you do not
43:22 want to understand the law of nature
43:23 applicable to everyone if your father
43:26 kept on perform performing such actions
43:28 which you are like pebbles and Stones is
43:30 bound to go down who can bring him up if
43:33 your father kept on performing actions
43:35 which are light like butter is bound to
43:37 go up who will pull down his legs we
43:40 don't try to understand our difficulty
43:43 we try to depend on somebody some
43:45 invisible power will do something for me
43:47 some invisible power will do something
43:49 for me and we do nothing to change our
43:52 own behavior pattern our own actions and
43:55 that is why one keeps on Rolling In
43:57 misery misery after misery misery after
43:59 Misery the earlier one understands this
44:02 law of Nature and earlier one starts to
44:06 live a life in line with this law of
44:08 nature the earlier one starts coming out
44:10 of the ignorance coming out of the
44:11 misery and starts enjoying a good
44:15 life once one agrees that I must be
44:18 careful about my actions the question
44:21 comes what is the
44:23 action what is the action which gives
44:25 fruit
44:27 there are three types of actions
44:29 physical
44:31 action vocal action and mental
44:34 action a very general understanding
44:37 common understanding is that physical
44:39 action is very important vocal action is
44:42 less important and mental action has got
44:45 no no much importance very
44:49 minor but when one starts observing the
44:52 truth
44:53 inside as this person did and became
44:55 enlightened it becomes so clear that the
44:58 mental action is most important not the
45:01 vocal not the physical they have their
45:04 own
45:05 effects but the most important is the
45:07 mental
45:09 action everything starts in the mind
45:13 first and then it becomes intense
45:16 intense intense this mental action turns
45:19 into vocal action it becomes more
45:22 intense more intense it turns into
45:23 physical action the vocal action the
45:26 phys physical action is nothing but the
45:29 projection of the mental action is a
45:32 yard stick to measure the intensity of
45:34 the mental action it is the mental
45:36 action which is most
45:38 important an
45:40 example I see somebody with whom I have
45:43 cross relation as soon as I see him my
45:46 mind starts working anger anger a mental
45:49 UNH wholesome mental action has started
45:52 it becomes intense intense intense
45:54 manifest itself as a vocal action I
45:57 shout I abuse UNH wholesome voal action
45:59 is the result it becomes more intense
46:02 more intense more intense manifest as
46:04 UNH wholesome physical action I slap him
46:07 if I have a gun I kill him shoot him
46:10 kill him un wholesome physical action
46:12 what is this UNH wholesome vocal action
46:14 or physical action just a projection of
46:16 the mental action just y to measure the
46:19 intensity of my UNH wholesome vocal
46:22 mental
46:24 action as UNH wholesome so also
46:27 wholesome I see somebody in a very
46:29 wretched miserable condition my start
46:31 mind starts working compassion
46:35 compassion this mental action wholesome
46:38 mental action manifest itself as a vocal
46:40 action when it becomes intense I speak a
46:43 few words kind words loving words
46:45 compassionate words wholesome vocal
46:47 action it becomes more intense more
46:49 intense manifest as a physical action I
46:51 help this person at physical level give
46:53 him something a wholesome physical
46:55 action wholesome or un wholesome all
46:58 vocal and physical actions are
47:01 projections of the mental action this is
47:05 the
47:08 realization of an enlightened person
47:11 this is The Enlightenment of an
47:12 Enlighten person mind matters most
47:16 everything starts in the mind everything
47:20 starts in the mind mind precedes
47:25 everything he is putting words to his
47:27 own experience when he
47:45 says mind precedes everything
47:50 else that is why mind is most important
47:54 mind matters most man May whatever you
47:58 experience throughout the life is
47:59 nothing but the product of your own mind
48:01 mana
48:04 [Music]
48:14 mana with the base of an un wholesome
48:17 mind an impure mind a defiled mind you
48:20 perform any action physical or vocal
48:23 then
48:28 [Music]
48:34 then misery will keep on following you
48:36 following
48:38 you like the wheel wheel of the cart
48:41 follows the horse who is yoked to that
48:45 particular cart wherever this cart goes
48:48 wherever this horse goes the wheel keeps
48:50 on following keeps on
48:52 following because the base was wrong so
48:55 the misery keeps on following you keeps
48:57 on following you
49:03 [Music]
49:09 similarly with the base of a pure mind
49:12 wholesome mind if you perform any action
49:15 vocal or physical then
49:21 [Music]
49:28 then all the happiness keeps on
49:30 following you following you like your
49:32 own shadow Wherever You Go Your Shadow
49:34 is there Wherever You Go Your Shadow is
49:36 there this is the law of
49:40 nature the base of the mind is most
49:43 important this is the base of the mind
49:45 which makes you act at the mental level
49:48 first and then it goes to the vocal
49:50 level and the physical level the result
49:53 that you get the fruit that you get is
49:55 the fruit of your mental action
49:58 Devolution of your
50:00 mind not the not the vocal action not
50:05 the physical
50:06 action an
50:09 example I see somebody with whom I got
50:12 cross
50:14 relation generate anger and then I shout
50:18 I abuse you dog you pig
50:22 Etc I don't know why you abused in your
50:24 in your country but in Hindi they say
50:25 you dog you Pig all you dog you pig you
50:29 donkey abused one incident over another
50:34 incident I see my grandchild having come
50:37 played in the mud somewhere and soiled
50:39 all the cloth I say you dog you pig you
50:43 donkey same words I've used the same
50:46 words at the vocal level the same action
50:49 is there but from the mind the mental
50:52 volution is PS apart when I was using
50:56 these words for my enemy it was full of
50:58 ill will when I'm using the same words
51:01 for my grandchild it is full of
51:04 Goodwill my nature takes care of the
51:07 volution of the mind not the the vocal
51:10 action the result that you will get the
51:12 fruit that you will get will be
51:14 according to the volution of the mind
51:16 not according to the vocal action so
51:18 also not according to the physical
51:20 action another
51:23 example a very rich person with lot of
51:25 money jewelry Etc
51:27 is traveling in a jungle alone a dco
51:29 robber comes from the other direction he
51:31 finds out this man has got lot of
51:34 money he wants that this person doesn't
51:37 want to depart from his money he says no
51:39 and out of anger he takes out his knife
51:41 and plunges in the stomach of this
51:43 traveler as a result of he dies one
51:46 incident another incident somebody has
51:49 developed a kind of H very
51:53 painful different treatments were given
51:56 could not be cured then his surgeon says
51:59 that well if I cut open take this ulcer
52:01 out perhaps you will be relieved all
52:03 right go ahead he's made to lie down in
52:05 the operation on the operation table in
52:07 the operation theater the surgeon takes
52:09 out the knife plunges in the stomach and
52:11 it so happens at that time this patient
52:15 dies the doctor and the
52:18 dco did the same thing at the physical
52:20 level they took out their respective
52:22 knives plunged in the stomach of
52:24 somebody as a result of which that
52:26 somebody died
52:27 now will the nature or say the God
52:29 Almighty is going to give the same
52:31 result to both of them oh no the mental
52:34 volution the mental volution of The
52:37 Deco was full of ill will and the mental
52:41 volution of this doctor full of Goodwill
52:44 the nature takes care of the mo
52:46 motivation of the Mind the volition of
52:48 the mind and the fruit comes exactly
52:51 according to that what is the base of
52:53 the Mind the base of the mind is more
52:56 important the volution of the mind is
52:58 more important than any action at the
53:00 physical or vocal level we have to be
53:04 careful about the mind and evolution of
53:07 the mind for that one must understand
53:10 what the mind is and how it works and
53:13 vush will help
53:15 you understand the whole technique is to
53:18 divide dissect disintegrate dissolve the
53:21 entire physical structure you won't have
53:23 to do anything you just observe observe
53:25 observe next nature will start dividing
53:28 dissecting disintegrating dividing
53:30 dissecting disintegrating dissolving
53:32 initially you get very gross solidified
53:35 intensified experiences of the body and
53:37 then they start getting dissolved
53:39 dissolved dissolved you reach the stage
53:41 where there is nothing but a very free
53:43 flow of subtle vibrations free flow of
53:46 energy very subtle very
53:48 subtle similarly the mind is divided
53:51 dissected
53:53 disintegrated one who becomes fully
53:55 enlightened
53:57 examines the entire mental and the
53:58 physical structure the physical
54:00 structure dividing dividing reaches the
54:03 stage the tinest subatomic particle
54:05 which equals atap eight things join
54:07 together they cannot be further
54:10 dissected similarly mind dividing
54:12 dividing dividing the mental contents
54:14 dividing dissecting one reaches the
54:16 stage where one finds there are 121
54:20 types of
54:21 Mind 52 types of mental contents which
54:25 you call mental concomitant
54:26 every mind arises with one concomitant
54:29 or the
54:30 other at this stage when you just
54:32 started the Kinder Garden ofas no use
54:36 even to remember those 52 and 121 minds
54:39 and mental contents now the four major
54:43 portion of the mind if you understand
54:45 them and if you understand how they
54:47 function you'll be experiencing them
54:50 that will be very helpful the four major
54:52 segments of the
54:54 Mind first segment of the Mind in the
54:58 language of those days in Buddha's words
55:01 it was called vyana the nearest English
55:04 translation of that can be
55:06 Consciousness first part of the Mind
55:09 Consciousness its job is to
55:13 cognize all the six sense doors we have
55:15 the eyes the ears the nose the tongue
55:19 the body body skin and the mind all the
55:23 six sense doors have six separate V
55:26 six separate Consciousness eye
55:28 Consciousness ear Consciousness nose
55:30 Consciousness tongue Consciousness body
55:33 Consciousness mind
55:37 conscious something contact at any sense
55:41 a soundes in contact with the ear sense
55:43 door and the ear Consciousness will
55:45 arise a shape a form a color a light
55:48 comes in contact with the eye sense door
55:50 eye Consciousness will arise smell comes
55:53 in contact with the nose nose
55:54 Consciousness will arise taste comes in
55:56 contact with the tongue tongue
55:58 Consciousness will arise something
56:01 tangible comes in contact with the body
56:03 body Consciousness will arise a thought
56:05 emotion comes in contact with the Mind
56:07 mind Consciousness will arrive this six
56:10 Consciousness their job is to cognize
56:13 something has happened ear Consciousness
56:16 a sound has come in contact with the ear
56:18 ear Consciousness arises look something
56:21 has happened and immediately another
56:24 part of the mind will raise its head
56:26 in the language of those days it was
56:28 called sa the nearest English
56:30 translation can be perception its job is
56:34 to
56:35 recognize a sound has come in contact
56:37 with the the first part will say
56:39 something has happened at the since to
56:41 that's all and the second part we'll try
56:44 to recognize what has happened words
56:47 what words words of abuse or words of
56:51 praise it recognizes with all the
56:54 experience of the past
56:56 all the conditioning of the past and all
56:58 the memory of the past it recognizes and
57:02 not only recognizes it gives a
57:05 evaluation words of abuse oh very bad
57:09 words of Praise ah
57:12 wonderful and as soon as this second
57:15 part has done its job third part starts
57:18 working in the language of those days it
57:20 was called V Sensations experiencing
57:24 Sensations on the body
57:27 as soon as evaluation is given that
57:30 these are words of praise and wonderful
57:32 you will notice there is a flow of very
57:35 subtle and pleasant vibrations
57:37 throughout the body there is a flow of
57:39 pleasant vibration because the
57:40 evaluation is that these are very good
57:43 words words of abuse and evaluation
57:46 given very bad and you find there's a
57:48 flow of very unpleasant sensation on the
57:51 body the third part of the Mind
57:53 experiences Sensations on the body
57:56 Pleasant unpleasant and then immediately
57:59 the fourth part of the Mind Des said in
58:01 the language of those days it was called
58:03 Sankara its job is to react this word
58:07 remember I'll be using it again and
58:09 again throughout this coming six days
58:11 Sankara it is actually the motivation of
58:15 the Mind the reaction of the mind and it
58:18 is something which is a heap of action
58:20 the first cognizing is not a action it
58:24 will not give any fruit
58:26 recognizing is not a action it won't
58:29 give any fruit feeling is not action it
58:32 won't give any fruit but this Sara the
58:34 reaction this is an action this gives
58:37 fruit because you repeatedly you keep on
58:40 repeating it repeating it words of
58:42 Praise pleasing sensation and this part
58:44 of the Mind keeps repeating I want it I
58:47 want more I want more craving craving
58:49 craving clinging continuously craving
58:51 clinging craving clinging words of abuse
58:54 unpleasant sensation this part the Mind
58:56 reacting abortion hat it I don't like it
58:58 I don't like it I want to get rid of it
59:00 abortion abortion abortion abortion
59:02 continuous continuous a
59:04 vertion this
59:06 shankara this is the volution of the
59:08 mind which results into mental
59:11 action and this gives
59:14 fruit how deep is your shankara how
59:17 strong is the seed what is the quality
59:20 of the Sara that that kind of fruit will
59:24 come there are three three types of
59:26 Saras one keeps on generating three
59:29 types of Saras wholesome un wholesome
59:32 leave aside three kinds of Saras one is
59:36 like a line drawn on the water as you
59:39 draw so it gets eliminated as you draw
59:42 so it gets eliminated second is like a
59:44 line drawn on the beach
59:46 sand morning you drawn a line by evening
59:49 it got eliminated and the third is like
59:52 a line drawn on rock deep line with
59:56 chasel and Hammer very deep it takes
59:59 years together to get it eradicated but
1:00:01 very deep line this third one is very
1:00:04 dangerous and this is what we keep on
1:00:06 doing when you keep on repeating
1:00:08 repeating anger and you keep on
1:00:09 repeating anger anger anger anger hatate
1:00:12 hatate hatate passion passion passion
1:00:14 fear fear fear worry worry worry anxiety
1:00:17 depression all these defilements you
1:00:20 keep on repeating repeating repeating it
1:00:22 goes deeper deeper deeper and it gives
1:00:25 deeper result
1:00:26 much more misery it will it will give
1:00:29 this you will understand more and more
1:00:31 as you practice this technique the
1:00:33 functioning of the Mind these four
1:00:35 sectors of the Mind the relation with
1:00:38 the body the interaction of the two how
1:00:41 one keeps on influencing the other how
1:00:43 one gets influenced by the other how the
1:00:45 shankara that I'm generating is becoming
1:00:46 deeper deeper deeper how if I more alert
1:00:49 attentive aware they don't go so deep
1:00:52 and I'm coming out of my misery that
1:00:53 becomes clearer and clearer
1:00:57 whole day you have been generating
1:00:59 Sankara after Sankara every time
1:01:01 something is happening deep inside some
1:01:03 sensation and you react some sensation
1:01:05 and you react every moment you're doing
1:01:07 that night you go to bed and you try to
1:01:10 remember how many shankaras are
1:01:12 generated the whole day you can't
1:01:14 remember countless shankaras you will
1:01:17 remember just one or two which which had
1:01:19 very deep impression on you oh today I
1:01:22 did like this which I should not have
1:01:24 done I I reacted like this which I
1:01:27 should not have reacted just one or
1:01:29 two at the end of the month you try to
1:01:32 remember these deep shankaras each day
1:01:34 one or two at the end of month not 30 or
1:01:38 60 at the end of month again one or two
1:01:40 which were very deep for the whole month
1:01:42 at the end of year also just one or two
1:01:45 which were very deep for the whole year
1:01:48 similarly at the end of the life whether
1:01:50 you like it or not Sam Sankara which is
1:01:54 very deep will come on the surface
1:01:57 at the time of death that moment the
1:01:59 Mind moment is carrying this type of
1:02:02 Sara the next mind is a child of this
1:02:07 mind the first mind of the next life is
1:02:10 a child of the last mind of this life
1:02:14 like father like son it will carry all
1:02:16 the qualities good or bad with it if
1:02:18 this last mind is full of Pebbles and
1:02:21 Stones the next mind that means the
1:02:23 first mind of the next life is full of
1:02:25 Pebbles and Stones misery nothing but
1:02:27 misery and if this last mind of this
1:02:31 life is full of butter light then the
1:02:33 next mind is automatically full of
1:02:35 butter is a product of the last mind
1:02:38 last mind is very
1:02:39 important that means one us to learn how
1:02:42 to die die smilingly and this is what V
1:02:47 teaches you anyone who gets established
1:02:50 in even little bit
1:02:52 established we
1:02:54 noticed that of course everyone dies
1:02:56 even meditator has to die VNA meditators
1:02:59 when they die there's not a single case
1:03:01 only one case little doubtful otherwise
1:03:03 hundreds who have died not a single
1:03:05 person has died unconscious not a single
1:03:09 person has died crying or with fear
1:03:12 everybody dies consciously and
1:03:15 smilingly oh death is coming coming
1:03:17 coming with this sensation coming coming
1:03:20 has come so you
1:03:23 observe why
1:03:24 cry there's a promotion there's no
1:03:27 demotion people cry because they see de
1:03:30 demotion there's demotion so they cry
1:03:32 when there's promotion no crying you're
1:03:34 going in a better place you're being
1:03:37 promoted meditator never cries in death
1:03:40 learns the art of dying and art of dying
1:03:43 will be only perfect when you learn Art
1:03:46 of Living if you keep on crying whole
1:03:48 life and then you want at the time of
1:03:50 death I will smile
1:03:52 impossible so you to learn how to smile
1:03:54 whole life are of living will turn into
1:03:58 art of dying Art of Living this is what
1:04:01 you're learning
1:04:03 now everything that happens outside
1:04:06 creates a sensation inside and this
1:04:09 first part will know something is
1:04:10 happening the second part will start
1:04:12 giving evaluation and this evaluation
1:04:14 will turn the sensation Pleasant or
1:04:16 unpleasant if you train your mind not to
1:04:20 get affected by the sensations Pleasant
1:04:22 or unpleasant not to react to the
1:04:24 sensations Pleasant and Pleasant then
1:04:26 you are changing the Habit pattern of
1:04:28 your mind at the deepest level even if
1:04:30 you react the Sankara will not be that
1:04:32 deep because you won't be repeating
1:04:33 again and again you will come to senses
1:04:36 of course now just a beginning now just
1:04:39 a beginning in 1 hour most of the time
1:04:41 you will be repeating this shankara
1:04:43 again and again oh so much of pain what
1:04:44 sort of meditation is this so much pain
1:04:47 I don't like pain you are repeating old
1:04:49 habit is there but you get few moments
1:04:52 when you say all let me see how long it
1:04:54 last I don't react I don't generate Sara
1:04:57 of abion and I observe few moments
1:05:00 wonderful moments when you are just
1:05:02 observing your head is above the water
1:05:05 and then you again start reacting your
1:05:06 head has gone below the water and you
1:05:08 don't know where you flowing and after
1:05:10 some time again the head comes above the
1:05:11 water those few moments when your head
1:05:14 is above the water are wonderful moments
1:05:17 those few moments will turn into few
1:05:19 seconds and these few seconds will turn
1:05:21 into few minutes and like this slowly
1:05:23 you turn the table you change the Habit
1:05:26 pattern of your mind you come out of
1:05:28 this misery every time you react and you
1:05:31 keep on re reacting for longer periods
1:05:33 you find your are just sunken misery
