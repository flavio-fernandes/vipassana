0:09 the second day is over you have now8 more left to
0:19 work to work diligently ently
0:30 second day slightly better than the first day
0:36 slightly better the difficulties are still
0:45 there what a wondering mind a fleeting mind a flickering
0:52 mind so inable so unstable so infirm
1:01 so agitated no peace no
1:06 Tranquility so wild like a wild
1:14 animal a monkey mind grasping one branch after the other
1:21 one branch after the other one object after the other one object after the other highly agitated
1:31 certainly very wild like a wild bull a wild
1:41 elephant when it
1:47 comes in the midst of a human society dwellings of human
1:53 beings it proves so dangerous it creates havoc so
2:05 harmful but an experienced person a wise
2:12 person trains this wild elephant the Wild
2:17 Bull tees this wild elephant the Wild Bull working very
2:25 patiently patiently and persistently
2:31 and once this wild animal is tamed trained all its enormous
2:40 strength come to serve the Human Society it starts serving the Human
2:48 Society its strength was a great Dinger to the human society
2:55 and now this very strength turns into a great service to the human
3:01 Society similarly this wild mind so long as it remains
3:09 untrained Untamed very
3:14 dangerous very dangerous very harmful and if you somehow train it tame
3:25 it it's enormous strength starts helping
3:33 us and the strength of the mind now comparison with the strength of
3:39 a wild elephant many more times it is
3:45 stronger more
3:51 powerful no one can harm us more than our own wild
3:58 mind and no one can help us more than our own trained mind tamed mind
4:06 disciplined mind but as it requires lot of
4:12 patience to train a wild elephant one who is experienced in
4:21 training the wild elephant or Wild Bull does not get
4:28 irritated does not develop anger or hatred towards this wild animal very
4:35 patiently one works very patiently but
4:41 persistently similarly you have to deal with your wild mind very
4:51 patiently you want to get it trained in one day or two days or
4:57 no no and you become irritated because it is not getting trained look I given two
5:04 days of my life and yet it's not getting trained you become agitated irritated it
5:11 becomes more wild it becomes more dangerous
5:17 patience you to work very patiently patiently but persistently persistently
5:24 continuously continuously ultimately
5:30 you will win the mind is bound to get
5:36 disciplined but you have to work no one else can work for
5:44 you you have to fight out your own battle you have to work out your own
5:51 salvation your own Liberation none else can do that for you
6:02 someone who has been successful in controlling the
6:08 Mind someone who has become successful in purifying the
6:13 Mind someone who has become liberated enlightened with all the compassion and
6:21 love this person will show the path but you have to walk on the path
6:30 you have to take every step on the path yourself step by step step by step you
6:36 have to reach the final goal nobody will take you on his
6:42 shoulder to the final goal nobody can take anyone else on the shoulder and
6:48 reach the final goal impossible each individual has to
6:55 work of course when you start taking steps on
7:00 the path of dhama the path of Liberation the path of
7:07 Enlightenment the law of nature is such the universal law of nature is such
7:14 that you get tuned up with the Good Vibrations of saintly people Good Vibrations of
7:21 dhama and you get all the inspiration and the strength you start getting so much
7:28 support I know know it with my own personal experience and also the experience of so
7:34 many students you will get
7:39 support you call it Grace you call it Mercy you call whatever you like you
7:45 will get support but still every step you have to take on the path you have to
7:51 take every step on the path an incident
7:59 in the life of gamad Buddha at that time he was
8:05 dwelling in a big Meditation Center in the city of
8:11 shasi capital of the state of kosa large number of monks and nuns will
8:19 come and learn via from him large number of householders men women will come and
8:26 learn this technique from him get benefited
8:32 someone who used to come only in these evening discourses but never
8:38 practiced he came one day little earlier when Buddha was alone came to
8:45 him paid respect and said sir one question keeps on bothering me
8:52 and I hesitate to ask you when there are so many people around now that you are alone permit me to ask the question oh
9:01 go ahead there should not be any confusion in your mind so far as dhma is concerned go ahead and he said
9:10 sir I'm coming here for a number of years I understand what you teach it is
9:19 good but I examine the people who come here to
9:25 learn I have noticed that some of them
9:30 have really become fully liberated fully enlightened it is quite clear with their
9:38 behavior with their lifestyle with their dealings with the people situations is very clear they are
9:45 liberated people and quite a few are not fully liberated and yet a
9:54 big change has come in their life I notice it a big change for the
9:59 better has come but then sir there are people like
10:07 me no change we are as
10:12 we my question is sir you are so
10:19 powerful you so compassionate somebody coming to you
10:26 taking refug in you why don't to use all your power and your compassion to liberate us why
10:34 somebody remains unliberated or half liberated please sir this question bothers
10:39 me Buddha smiled this is what he kept on teaching
10:44 but people do not want to understand what can I do so he
10:51 explained and his way of explanation was always different according to the caliber of the mind of the student who
10:57 has come at times he will answer by counter questioning so in this this case
11:04 also he started counter questioning hey from where are you sir I'm from shasti
11:10 this city the capital of kosa oh no no your facial features say that you are
11:17 not from this country you are from some other state and you come and settle down
11:23 here oh yes sir you are quite correct actually I belong to magada rajgiri
11:30 I come and settled down here last few years good having come and settled down
11:36 here have you severed all relations with rajgiri with
11:42 magada you don't go there anymore oh no sir I keep going there I still have my
11:48 relatives there I my friends there I my business there I keep going there every
11:53 year I go many times to rajgiri and come back I say you keep going from here to
12:01 rajgiri so certainly you must be knowing very well the path from here to rajgiri
12:06 because you walk toward the path so many times yes sir I know the path so well
12:13 now tell me having settled down in this part of the country you must have made
12:19 many friends and out of these many friends somehow become very intimate to you isn't it yes sir some have become very
12:27 intimate those who are very intimate they certainly should be knowing that you don't belong to this part you are
12:34 actually from magad from rajgiri and you come and settle down here and they also must be knowing that
12:41 you keep going to rajgiri and coming back every year so many times yes
12:47 sir then these people know that you know the path from here to rajgiri very well yes sir some of them must be asking you
12:55 how about this path what kind of path do you keep it a top secret or you explain
13:01 what top secret sir I explain them very clearly you start from here from shast
13:07 start moving eastwards and you move this way that way you turn this way that way and you will reach Varanasi and then you
13:14 keep moving this way that way turn here there you will reacha and then you keep
13:19 moving this and you will Raji I explain the whole path very clearly very clearly
13:26 that means everyone to whom you explained the path path must have reached rajgiri how is that possible sir
13:34 if someone has not walked on the path how will he reach Raj young man this is
13:39 what I keep on telling every day people come to me understanding very well that
13:45 this is a person who is fully liberated he has reached the final goal he knows the path from here to the final goal
13:52 they come to me they ask me what is the path why I keep it as a top secret I
13:59 explained them very clearly this is how you walk this is how you walk and you will get this station and this station
14:05 and you keep walking keep walking and you will reach the final goal someone just
14:12 listens and says s and boow down three
14:19 times but won't take a single step on the path how will this person reach the
14:24 world what can I do I have shown the path my job is done some body has
14:29 started taking steps on the path someone has taken just one step on the
14:34 path this person is one step nearer the goal someone has taken 100 steps on the
14:41 path this person is 100 steps nearer the goal someone has taken all the steps on
14:46 the path has reached the goal each individual has to take steps on the
14:54 path no one else can do that no one else
15:00 if I thirsty and someone else drinks water my thirst will not get quenched for
15:08 quenching my thirst I must drink water if I sick and someone else takes
15:15 medicine my sickness will not get cured I have to take medicine myself so
15:20 simple and yet we don't want to work and we just expect some other
15:28 Supernatural power to be very kind to do something for us it doesn't work doesn't
15:35 work each individual has to work out one's own salvation each individual has to take
15:42 every step on the path and he
15:48 explains in his own words the P the language that he spoke
15:54 the language of India of those days
16:03 [Music]
16:20 you you have to work diligently ardently for your
16:25 Liberation someone who has become tagat
16:30 that means when has become liberated the literal meaning tagat when was reached the final goal of ultimate truth the
16:38 Eternal truth when who reach that goal will very compassionately point out to
16:44 the path this is the path he will just point out this is the
16:54 path everyone who has reached that goal will only point out the
17:01 PA but each individual has to walk on the PA each individual is to work out
17:07 one's own salvation if this is
17:13 accepted and earlier one accepts it the better one accepts that I have to walk
17:20 on the path every step I have to take today the final go then the question comes what is the
17:26 path and how to walk over it and he explained he kept on explaining this is
17:33 what he did the whole life kept on explaining the path the
17:41 dhma dhma means law dma is truth dama is
17:50 nature the law of nature universal law of nature which governs the entire universe
17:58 animate in any way is now a sectarian
18:06 Universal want us to understand what is this law what is this
18:12 nature want us to understand that if I break the law I get punished then and
18:20 there if I live a life in line with the law in accordance to the law I start
18:26 getting rewarded I start moving towards the final goal of
18:32 Liberation and this is the path someone came to him and asked him
18:39 sir in few words few simple words tell me what is
18:45 the path I can't understand High philosophies and all that and Buddha
18:50 smil T is not for high philosophies it is for people
18:56 to practice so they must understand what it is if
19:01 they don't understand and simply play intellectual game with it it doesn't help dma is always explained in very
19:09 simple words all right I will again explain you and he explained in few words again in his own
19:17 words in the language that he spoke in those days
19:47 [Music]
19:56 Bud SAS s is the teaching Bud all the Buddhas this
20:04 is the teaching of all the budas you never said this is my
20:10 teaching Buddha is not a name of somebody Buddha means an enlightened
20:15 person liberated person his name was
20:20 G and to become Buddha is not more you have only one
20:26 person not just only go can become Buddha anyone can become Buddha of course it is
20:32 not that easy you come for 10 days and become Buddha no very hard work very hard
20:42 work yet doing hard work hard work hard work
20:47 there is every possibility of everyone becoming a fully enlightened person becoming Buddha and when someone becomes
20:54 a Buddha he will teach this and nothing else
20:59 this will be the teaching of every enlightened person what is
21:14 itain all all sinful activities abstain from
21:22 all sinful activities UNH wholesome activities and
21:35 perform wholesome actions Pi actions enter the field of
21:44 piy get ordained iny
21:52 and keep on purifying your mind keep on purifying your mind that's all
22:00 abstain from UNH wholesome sinful actions perform wholesome Pi
22:07 actions and keep on purifying your mind the entire D mind totality is
22:15 contained in it nothing is missing you won't have to add anything
22:21 to this that is why it is called complete it is complete
22:30 and you won't have to take out anything from it there is not even a DOT which is wrong which has to be taken out that is
22:39 called so pure Ultra Pure nothing to take out from it nothing to add to it
22:46 this is abstain from sinful action perform P
22:53 action purify the mind every religion worth the name we
22:58 say the same thing but then when an enlightened person teaches
23:06 D he teaches Universal D he will never teach sectarian
23:12 Universal dhal D the law of nature is eternal it
23:18 was there so in the past it is so present it is it will be so in the future and it's applicable to one and
23:25 all that is T but out of madness out of
23:31 ignorance people forget the essence of T and they make a sect out of
23:38 it and this sect or this sect or this sect then these very words will start
23:44 carrying different meanings everyone will recite the same thing abstain from sinful action no
23:52 religion will say you keep on performing s actions every one will say the same
23:58 same thing perform wholesome action Pious action every religion every tradition will say that purify your mind
24:05 every religion every tradition everyone will say that but yet a big
24:12 difference a big difference in the
24:18 explanations what is sin and what is
24:25 piety when dhma turns into a sect then that particular
24:32 sect the socalled religious people of that particular sect the so-call pious
24:38 people of this particular sect they may be wearing this kind of robe or that
24:44 kind of robe maybe having this rosary or that Rosary maybe having this Mark over the
24:51 forehead or that Mark over the forehead this external appearance or that external
24:56 appearance now people belonging to this particular sect will say those who have
25:02 this kind of external appearance are Pi people others are not definition is given a wrong
25:09 definition is given another definition every
25:17 sect people belonging to that particular sect will perform this kind of right or
25:23 that kind of ritual this religious ceremony or that religious ceremony every sect will have different different
25:28 rights different rituals different ceremonies and those belonging to a particular sect will say those who are
25:35 performing these rights these rituals these ceremonies oh they are Pi people
25:42 and those who do not they're not Pi they're sinful another mad definition is
25:51 given for sin and piety one more definition is given
25:59 which is still more confusing every sect has some
26:05 belief some Dogma some philosophy we believe in this philosophy
26:12 this Dogma those who believe in this Dogma in this philosophy are very Pious people
26:18 those who do not believe they not Pi people such kind of definitions of sin
26:25 and piety har d d is no more
26:32 D in DH the definition is universal not
26:38 sectarian external appearan will differ from sect to sect from person to person
26:44 rights rituals ceremonies will differ from person to person from SE to se a
26:49 philosophical belief May differ from person to person from SE to se but the definition of DH cannot
26:56 differ it is univers and it is
27:03 eternal what is sin what is UNH wholesome
27:08 action any action physical or vocal any action that
27:16 you perform and it harms and hurts other
27:23 beings it disturbs that peace and Harmony of other beings is a sinful
27:29 action is an un wholesome action and what is a Pious action what
27:36 is a wholesome action every action physical or vocal which supports helps other
27:44 beings in living a peaceful harmonious atmosphere which does not disturb their
27:51 peace their Harmony which does not harm them does not hurt them is a bias
27:58 whome action this definition is
28:07 universal as one keeps going deeper in Dharma at the experiential level it
28:15 becomes so clear that this is in line with the law of nature in line with the law of
28:26 nature the first abstain from all sinful action is called
28:32 cila living the life of morality don't perform any
28:39 action physical or vocal which will har other beings live a moral
28:49 life perform wholesome
28:54 actions and the most wholesome action is to be master of your
29:01 mind never remain slave of your mind learn how to concentrate your mind
29:07 one pointedness with the base of
29:13 wholesomeness without having anything against anybody anger or hatred or ill
29:20 will this is the most wholesome action
29:28 this becomes very clear as one starts taking steps on the path the look the
29:34 teaching is so Universal so Universal the first is called Sheila the
29:40 second is called samadhi and the third purification of the mind is called PA
29:45 that means wisdom Insight direct experience of the truth
29:51 insight and developing the wisdom of the law the universal law and change
29:58 changing the Habit pattern of the mind at the deepest level now the first Sheila
30:05 morality initially one starts understanding it merely at the intellectual level yes I should not
30:12 perform any action at the physical level or vocal level which will harm other
30:18 beings for example if someone comes and hits me kills me I certainly don't like
30:26 it I don't like it so if I hit others or kill others this person will not like so I should not do
30:33 anything which I don't want others to do for me I should not
30:41 kill this will hurt others harm others if someone steals away robs away
30:48 certain thing which belongs to me and which is very dear to me I don't like it I feel hurt
30:55 therefore I should not steal anything belonging to somebody else this will
31:00 hurt this person I should not do it
31:08 someone rapes or has sexual
31:14 misconduct with a member of my family I don't like it I get hurt similarly I
31:20 should not do the same thing others will get hurt someone speaks lies and tries to
31:26 deceive me I don't like like it I should not speak lie and try to
31:31 deceive others someone speaks harsh words and I don't like I should not
31:37 speak harsh words to others they won't like
31:44 it and then although I understand and everyone
31:51 understands that one should not do this should not do that but when one gets intoxicated
31:58 by any drug or by liquor one is helpless when is slay of
32:06 that particular intoxication and will perform all those actions which one does not want to perform and yet one perform
32:14 I should not take any kind of intoxicants this is what one understands
32:20 at the surface level of the mind or the intellectual level of the mind again one starts understanding
32:27 again at little deeper level but again at the intellectual level a human being is a social
32:36 being he us to live in the society live with the members of the family and
32:43 others if he keeps on performing such actions which disturb the entire
32:49 atmosphere around creates disharmony everywhere disturbs the peace everywhere
32:56 how can this this person enjoy peace and
33:02 Harmony if I ignite fire fire all around all around there is Fire Burning Fire
33:08 how can I expect the cool the Tranquility Within
33:13 Myself not possible so I must help the atmosphere
33:18 to be more peaceful more tranquil and then only I can experience
33:24 peace and Tranquility living in that atmosphere yes becomes
33:31 clear but the D becomes really clear
33:36 when one starts practicing it and an enlightened person takes one
33:41 to that depth where one starts experiencing the law of
33:46 nature it will become so clear at the experiential level that whenever I perform any action
33:55 physical or vocal which has harmed other people I cannot perform that unless I have
34:02 generated tremendous amount of negativity in my mind I can't kill
34:08 somebody unless I generate anger hatate ill will animosity I cannot steal anything unless
34:14 I have generated lot of greed I cannot commit sexual misconduct unless I have
34:20 generated passion and likee this maybe ego maybe jealousy some impurity or the
34:28 other I must develop in my mind and then only I perform a vocal or physical action which will harm
34:36 others by experience one who is walking on the path of dhma will start understanding it
34:43 by experience and we'll also start understanding that whenever I generate
34:50 any negativity in the mind anger hatred ill will animosity passion fear ego
34:56 jealousy greed any impurity in my mind nature does not want it it goes
35:03 against the law of Nature and nature starts punishing me I get the punishment here now after death a punishment will
35:12 come leave that aside we don't say that don't believe it but leave it aside you
35:17 will get punishment here and now every individual who started walking on the
35:22 path will start realizing nature started punishing me
35:27 because when I generate anger I become so agitated so unhappy so miserable it
35:33 is impossible that I generate anger and feel very peaceful feel full of Tranquility
35:38 impossible I'm bound to become agitated similarly any defilement I'm bound to
35:44 become agitated law of nature is such nature has started punishing me and if I am I refrain from abstain
35:53 from these kinds of activities and don't generate these defilements in the mind nature starts rewarding me I feel so
36:00 peaceful it becomes so clear this is the law of nature don't harm others don't hurt
36:09 others don't perform any action at the physical or vocal level which will disturb
36:15 others because you do not know you have started harming yourself you are the
36:21 first victim of Your Action you want to kill somebody D anger
36:27 when you generate anger you are being punished then and there you are the first victim of your own anger your own
36:34 defilement this becomes clearer and clearer to somebody who walks on the
36:39 path of T then at a deeper level because one has started
36:45 experiencing the truth inside the behavior pattern the way of
36:50 life starts changing automatically because one is not
36:56 experiencing the truth inside all the time one gives importance
37:01 to things outside outside outside one does not know how Nature has started punishing me one does not know how the
37:08 Nature has started rewarding me one does not know at all now with this practice which you
37:15 will learn for these 10 days it will become clearer and clearer and once it
37:20 becomes clearer at the experiential level not merely at the intellectual level not merely at the devot level
37:28 because Buddha said so or our founder of our religion said said so or scriptures say so that doesn't work at the
37:35 experiential level the direct experience then it is something like you put your hand on the fire and your hand burns now
37:42 you know putting the hand on the fire touching the fire hurts me next time
37:47 you're very careful not to put your hand on the fire you don't like your hand to get burned so you will keep away from
37:54 this you will start experiencing it deep within yourself that whenever you hurt
38:00 others before hurting anybody you started hurting yourself you started
38:05 burning inside the Hell Fire Within You starts burning you here and
38:11 now and when you live a wholesome action a good action which helps others the
38:19 Kingdom of Heaven within you start enjoying the peace the peace the Tranquility of the
38:26 Kingdom of Heaven Within the hell is within the heaven is
38:31 within and this one starts experiencing and this helps
38:38 one to practice dama properly abstain from all evil actions perform wholesome
38:47 actions the path is explained in detail how you will walk on the path
38:53 step by step the whole path is called in the language
39:00 of those dayso Mago means
39:07 path are you noble noble path Noble Path
39:14 in the sense that anyone who walks on the path is bound to become a noble person he may belong to this country or
39:21 that country this community or that Community this color or that color this gender or that gender
39:28 makes no difference anyone who walks on the path is bound to become a noble
39:33 person a saintly person a good-hearted person a pure-hearted person that is why it is called Noble
39:41 Path Eightfold Eightfold Noble Path now
39:46 this is divided in three divisions Sheila
39:51 samadi Sheila morality don't perform any ction at the
39:58 physical or vocal level which will harm others three parts of the path come in
40:05 this morality Sheila
40:11 s [Music]
40:16 s the word s means right
40:21 righta the speech the speech must be right wholesome
40:29 how can you know what is wholesome what is UNH wholesome if you know what is UNH wholesome and you abstain from it what
40:35 remains is wholesome what is UNH wholesome so far as speech is concerned
40:40 your vocal action is concerned you abstain from speaking lies
40:47 this is UNH wholesome if you speak lies you abstain from speaking harsh
40:54 words which hurt others does not help them in any way because if you do that it is UNH
41:01 wholesome you abstain from speaking words of backbiting two persons are friends and
41:09 you hear something from here and then say something else to the other person and then you hear something you break
41:15 their friendship make them enemies you have performed UNH wholesome
41:20 action or you just talk slanderous words un wholesome action useless words
41:26 wasting your time wasting the time of others un wholesome B elction abstain from all this and what remains is the
41:34 wholesome action s wholesome vocal action
41:41 s whome physical action same yard sck any action which
41:49 hurts and harms other beings is UNH wholesome you abstain from that and what
41:55 remains is wholesome don't
42:00 kill don't steal don't perform sexual
42:06 misconduct don't take any kind of intoxicants if you abstain from that
42:12 then all your physical actions are wholesome automatically wholesome what remains is
42:19 wholesome s AA right
42:24 livelihood unless one is a monk or nun or a reuse or a Hermit in that case one
42:30 goes out with a bagging ball and doesn't keep anything with him or her but a householder is not supposed to
42:38 go out with a bing ball has to work to ear livelihood and work hard and work
42:47 honestly without harming others now the same yti without harming
42:54 others your profession your dealings must be
43:01 such that yes you get your remuneration from
43:06 that but it does not harm others if you get lot of profits in your
43:13 business and that business is harming others it is not sah AA not s
43:20 AA if your means of livelihood is such which encourages other people to
43:27 break Sheila and live a immoral life and disturb the peace and Harmony of others
43:33 it is not a s not a right livelihood for
43:38 example someone starts doing business of arms
43:45 ammunitions guns bullets bombs atom bombs hydrogen bombs one gets a lot of
43:51 money good profit but anyone who buys will use it for killing
43:58 others not a good livelihood not a right livelihood someone says I don't kill yes
44:04 you don't kill but you help others to kill you're encouraging others to kill not right
44:14 livelihood someone deals
44:19 in flesh or meat fish and I don't kill somebody else
44:27 is killed you're encouraging someone else to kill not right livelihood when day you seen
44:34 animals CZ his animal and then give it to the butcher he kills I don't kill no
44:42 you're encouraging it not right livelihood One deals in Poison anyone
44:48 who takes makes use of it to kill others not right livelihood like this
44:54 anything the commodity in which you are dealing if it encourages others to break their
45:01 Sheila then your livelihood is not livelihood even certain
45:08 livelihoods which look quite wholesome but the motivation is
45:17 wrong if the motivation is wrong it becomes un
45:22 wholesome one incident in my life years back when I was not in contact with pure
45:27 DH I never knew how to observe things inside and yet I used to feel myself a very damic person a very religious
45:34 person performing this r that ritual this this giving this donation that donation I never pure
45:40 D it so happened a member of the family became very ill and it so happened that
45:46 the family doctor was out of the station I to call some other doctor another doctor was very famous doctor
45:54 but very busy doctor whether he will agree to give a visit at home or not let
46:00 me go personally and persuade him I went to him usually there's a big crowd of
46:07 patient now I find nobody he was just alone of course I was happy that if he's alone he will
46:13 come but out of curiosity I asked him how is it doctor every there is a long
46:19 queue of patients in your dispensary to nobody's there with a very long and sad
46:24 face he says going this part this season this part of the Year always there is
46:30 some epidemic or the other I don't know what happened this year there's no emic I felt so
46:37 bad what a noble profession a doctor's profession a physician's profession to serve others to come out of illness and
46:45 look his motivation he wants more and more epidemic to start not that all doctors are like that he shouldn't
46:51 condemn every doctor but that was the case and I felt very bad
46:57 but at that time I never knew how to observe the reality inside so long as one does not know how
47:04 to observe the reality inside one keeps on finding fault with others look so and so is so bad so and so is so bad so and
47:10 so is so bad when I start this technique observing the truth inside I found out
47:17 I'm worse than the doctor I come from a business Community a business family and
47:24 we know the business people mostly the
47:29 motivation they their own vocabulary Suppose there is war or
47:36 famine consumer goods are scarce prices start shooting up in our language
47:43 commercial language we say Market is improving wonderful Market is improving
47:48 we get more price more profit whatever stock we have got will carry bring more profit Market is
47:53 improving no more famine no more war lot of consumer goods Market has gone down
48:00 and with a very sad heart you say oh Market is crushed so bad it is so
48:07 bad what attitude what kind of motivation we don't care whether people
48:12 suffer or not we must get our money oh this one will not understand
48:17 unless one starts observing the truth inside one remains so much involved so
48:22 much involved in the madness there is nothing wrong in doing business one has to earn
48:29 money reasonably without harming others provided one keeps on
48:35 understanding that I am playing the role an important role to serve the community in this particular way one
48:42 maybe in any profession but if one keeps on thinking that by this profession I serving the society and in return I get
48:49 my remuneration from the society then serving the society becomes more important remuneration will certainly
48:55 come nothing wrong a businessman buys from the manufacturer and and distributes to the consumer
49:01 nothing wrong in that every consumer cannot run to the manufacturer to buy his requirements there must be a middleman but this middleman if he
49:08 starts thinking that I'm here to exploit and get money then this red race of
49:13 money money money will make this person mad far away from dhama far away from
49:19 dhma s AA wants you to have a good
49:24 potion good motivation towards money without harming others serving people a
49:29 member of the society Parts his or her own role to serve the society in the
49:35 capacity that one can all these three s
49:41 s Sama AA right speech right physical actions
49:47 and right livelihood they all come in the first part of dhma Sheila
49:54 morality if the teacher of dhma had only taught
50:02 this then he was not an unlighted person unlighted will teach the totality
50:08 of this is only partial just to teach people and tell
50:14 them oh you people of the world you should not do this you should not do this you should not do this you should
50:20 do this you should do this you should do this people will hear from this year and it will go out of the other ear it won't
50:27 have any effect because one knows very well that I
50:32 should not do this I should not do this and yet one keeps on doing the same thing a drunker knows very well that it
50:40 is not good for me I must come out of the addiction is so bad a gambler knows very well I should
50:47 not do this and yet when the time comes he forgets everything he drinks he gambles why
50:55 because he has no control over the mind he has no Mastery over the mind he slave
51:01 of his own mind he slave of his own behavior pattern deep inside D is not complete just to give
51:08 sermons like this just to talk of Sheila doesn't help so the next step
51:14 samadi Mastery over the mind you to learn how to become master
51:20 of your own mind you to learn how to concentrate your mind
51:27 and concentrate your mind with the wholesome
51:34 base the concentration of mind with the base of Purity this is
51:42 sadii another three parts of dhma come under this division of sadii
51:50 s s sa s samadi s
51:57 right type of efforts right type of exercises you to take some
52:04 exercises when your body is weak when your body is sick unhealthy so weak that
52:10 you can't take even few steps you keep on dangling here dangling there somebody will ask you advise you take this
52:16 exercise this exercise make your muscle strong make your body
52:21 strong similarly when the Mind becomes weak and and all of you have noticed 2
52:27 days working 2 days what a sick mind you carrying what a weak mind you're
52:33 carrying dangling here dangling there so infirm so
52:39 unstable you have to do some exercises to make it stable firm strong healthy
52:47 sound any exercise which makes your mind healthy is a good exercise this is
52:54 s there are four exerc ex es in D every exercise is examine
53:01 yourself first exercise examine yourself oh even at the surface level of
53:06 the mind at present I have got this voice that voice this voice this
53:12 voice get rid of them get rid of the voices which are there first good
53:18 exercise second exercise again examine your mind my mind does not carry this
53:23 particular Voice or this particular voice close all the doors of your mind
53:29 whatever impurity is not there don't allow it to come second good exercise
53:34 third good exercise again examine your mind my mind is this particular virtue
53:40 that particular virtue don't develop ego because of that don't develop proud because of
53:46 that this virtue is there this is the reality now I must see that I preserve
53:51 it I maintain it and I multiply it again examine in your mind and you
53:58 find that you don't have this particular virtue or that particular virtue open all the gates of your mind welcome this
54:05 virtue which is not here should come in should come in these are the four healthy
54:10 exercises to make the Mind healthy strong this is what you started doing
54:16 indirectly and the next s Sati awareness right type of awareness what
54:24 is right type of awareness the awareness of the reality of this
54:30 moment pertaining to your own physical and mental structure is the right type of
54:36 awareness awareness cannot be of the past the word Sati has got two meanings
54:42 one meaning is a memory which has nothing to do with this this part of
54:48 dhama a memory is of the past you keep on thinking of the past this is not
54:53 samasti this is not right awareness awareness cannot be of the future you'll
55:00 be just thinking you'll be just imagining you'll be just dreaming doesn't H awareness is real when you are
55:08 with the awareness of the reality of this moment as it is manifested itself
55:13 from moment to moment from moment to moment and this reality must be
55:20 pertaining to your own being this mind this matter the combination of the
55:27 too this is what you started doing you started observing your breath
55:32 coming in going out from moment to moment as it is if it is deep it is deep
55:38 if it is shallow it is shallow if it passes through left nostril left nostril right nostril right nostril both the
55:45 nostrils both the nostrils just the reality as it is as it is of course for
55:51 a new student you are permitted when you can't feel the breath which is become
55:56 very subtle then you are permitted to take a few intentional breathings
56:01 conscious breathings slightly hard breathings but just a few and you again
56:07 to come to the natural breath normal breath so that you make your
56:13 capability you develop your faculty to feel the subtlest breath very clearly
56:19 the softest breath very clearly then you are with the reality as it is not as you
56:25 want it to be but as it is and that is called y as it is from moment to moment as it
56:33 is you have been doing that and another thing the whole path takes you from very
56:40 gross gross intensified solidified apparent reality because that is what
56:46 you experience initially and then you move move towards subtler subtler
56:51 subtler subtler reality expl the entire field of this
56:58 material structure from the grossest reality to the subtlest
57:04 reality explore the entire field of the mental structure the mind and the mental
57:09 contents from the grossest reality surface level and then subtler subtler
57:16 subtler in the language of those days he saido
57:22 fromo to sukuma sukuma step must be towards sukuma sukuma
57:29 sukuma subtlety subtlety subtlety you cross the entire field of subtlty of
57:34 mind and matter then you experience something which is beyond mind and matter the entire field of mind and
57:41 matter you will notice is a field where things arise pass arise pass arise pass
57:48 some change some change is taking place there's a constant flux a constant flow going on but when you cross this field
57:55 nothing arise nothing passes this is something the Eternal ultimate truth you
58:01 can't imagine on the path of dma nothing Should Be Imagined and nothing should be
58:06 accepted because a Buddha said so or because your teacher says so you have to experience it and that experience will
58:13 make you a totally changed person experience of that ultimate truth even
58:18 for a few seconds turns one into a saintly person
58:24 naturally and the entire part as you are moving from the gross reality towards the subtler subtler is a process of
58:31 purification and you will understand as you proceed further on the path so one thing clear that you are moving from the
58:37 gross reality towards the subtle reality but understand you can't create subtle
58:43 reality you have to leave it to the DH you have to leave it to the nature and nature will keep on working so for you
58:50 whatever manifest itself you are just aware of it initially you have to take few hard
58:57 breaths and you are aware of it then naturally the breath becomes subtler and subtler softer and softer finer and
59:03 finer you are aware of it now today whole day you are aware of the
59:10 touch of the breath within this limited area you were choosen a small area the Buddha wanted us to work with the small
59:17 area because smaller the area the subtler the mind is bound to become more sensitive the mind is bound
59:24 to become now small are tomorrow day after tomorrow you will have still smaller area now you work on the
59:29 Triangular area within this triangular area whole day you were working the
59:35 touch of the breath touch of the breath anywhere on the inner walls of the nostrils touch of the breath anywhere on
59:42 the outer rings of the nostrils touch of the breath anywhere on the area below the nostrils above the upper lip touch
59:48 of the breath touch of the breath now tonight and tomorrow whole day you will
59:55 experience some things subtler than that as this touch was there all the time but
1:00:00 you never cared to be aware of it because you never practiced Now by practicing you made your mind sharper to
1:00:07 feel this touch similarly there are subtler things which are there all the time but you never care to be aware of
1:00:14 it now this technique will help you and you will start feeling one thing one reality which will
1:00:21 become very clear very evident you will notice that the breath
1:00:28 that went in and when it came out it came out slightly
1:00:34 warmer the temperature of the incoming breath and the outgoing breath differs
1:00:40 the outgoing breath is slightly warmer this is truth but you never care to be aware of it and it is just natural the
1:00:49 temperature of the outside atmosphere is lower than the temperature inside the body so this breath from the outside
1:00:57 atmosphere going in your body comes in contact with the warmer temperature there and comes out slightly warmer you
1:01:03 will notice that that the outgoing breath is slightly warmer than the incoming breath and then very
1:01:11 soon you will start experiencing something more something some reality which has
1:01:18 nothing to do with the breath you use the breath to move towards the subtler
1:01:24 reality now if even without using the breath what is happening you have been working on this small area this
1:01:30 triangular area by tonight by tomorrow you will
1:01:35 start experiencing some biochemical reaction taking place here some
1:01:40 electromagnetic reaction which is taking place throughout the body throughout the physical structure every moment there is
1:01:48 some biochemical reaction or the other some electromagnetic reaction or the other and because of that some sensation
1:01:55 or the other throughout the body wherever there is life there is bound to be a
1:02:01 sensation now in this area you will start feeling some
1:02:06 sensation not necessarily this particular sensation or that particular sensation any s any Sensation that crops
1:02:15 up maybe heat you start feeling heat in this
1:02:20 area within this area only heat it can be body heat it can be
1:02:26 atmospheric heat heat you just observe there is heat at this moment there is
1:02:32 heat that's all maybe cold maybe perspiration just observe to
1:02:38 nothing maybe an itching sensation again just observe an itching sensation don't
1:02:44 react to it an itching sensation and you start reacting you start rubbing it or
1:02:49 scratching it then it is not samasati samasti is just observe do nothing
1:02:55 observe the reality which has manifested itself and itching has started let me see how long it lasts it
1:03:03 becomes stronger stronger stronger but ultimately passes away no itching is eternal it is not going to stay forever
1:03:10 let me see how long it last any sensation not going to last forever it arises sooner or later passes away it
1:03:18 arises sooner or later passes away and you are just a Silent Witness of things
1:03:23 that are happening maybe itching maybe a tickly sensation at times maybe a prickling
1:03:31 sensation at times maybe a throbbing sensation a pulsing
1:03:36 sensation maybe a sensation of lightness maybe a sensation of heaviness maybe
1:03:42 pressure maybe tension maybe strain maybe even pain maybe a sensation of
1:03:49 expansion contraction expansion contraction maybe a sensation of
1:03:54 numbness maybe a sensation of dryness maybe a sensation of moisture anything
1:04:01 you can't choose Sensations it's a choiceless observation let the nature play its own role let D
1:04:08 play its own role from moment to moment whatever manifest itself this is the
1:04:13 reality of this moment and your job is just to accept it and observe it observe it without reacting to it just observe
1:04:21 just observe just observe don't look for something which is not there
1:04:26 otherwise you will get lost whatever comes up there you accept it and observe
1:04:33 it quite possible that you may feel a
1:04:38 sensation which you cannot name or label not necessary to name or label
1:04:44 even the sensations that you can name or label should not be named or labeled no
1:04:50 something is happening and you are just observing it objectively without reacting to it our purp is served this
1:04:56 is what the technique wants us to do just accept the reality of this movement as it
1:05:02 is without reacting to it so any sensation maybe at times you don't feel
1:05:09 any Sensations sensation is there every moment on every little particle of the
1:05:14 body but your mind is very gross so it can't feel subtle reality so at times
1:05:20 you don't feel anything within this limit then fall back to respiration your respiration already right keep on
1:05:26 working with respiration respiration and suddenly a sensation crops up then start giving importance to The Sensation that
1:05:32 has cropped up and remain with that sensation the sensation passes away some other sensation might crop up that
1:05:39 passes away something else might crop up nothing crops up again respiration either respiration or sensation but give
1:05:45 more importance to sensation quite possible at times you
1:05:51 may feel more than one sensation in this area 2 three sensation at the same
1:05:57 time don't get confused because of that choose one and choose which is
1:06:05 subtlest one which is very strong you can feel it so easily live that one
1:06:10 which is very feeble give importance to the feeble one and try to feel that Feer one feebler one your mind will become
1:06:17 more and more sensitive more and more subtle to feel that understand you to keep your
1:06:24 attention within this limit area this will make your mind sharp and more sensitive if you allow it to scatter
1:06:31 throughout the body then again it will remain very gross and it will feel only very gross Sensations and you can't go
1:06:36 to the depth as Buddha wanted you to go to the depth so while you are here something might start on other parts of
1:06:43 the body you can't stop it never try to stop it but ignore it don't give it any
1:06:48 importance something is happening somewhere my job is to explore the reality of this area this triangular
1:06:55 area if anything happening on the inner walls of the nostrils any sensation crops up I
1:07:00 will observe any sensation crops up on the outer walls of the nostrils yes I will observe any sensation crops up on
1:07:07 the outer rings of the nostrils yes I will observe any sensation crops up on the area below the nostrils above the
1:07:14 upper lip yes I will observe it but anything beyond that I will ignore then you will find your mind is limited to a
1:07:21 small area and working on a small area it becomes sharper and sharper sharper sharper and sharper work this night and
1:07:28 then tomorrow whole day this is SAS Sati and the next is
1:07:33 Sama samadi now samadi is concentration of the mind but Sama
1:07:40 samadhi is different with the base wholesome base and what is wholesome
1:07:47 base free from moha the other day we talked moha ignorance No Illusion no
1:07:56 delusion no hallucination no confusion and no
1:08:02 imagination the object of your concentration should be
1:08:08 real whatever you are practicing as sasti awareness of the reality of this
1:08:14 moment reality of this moment that you are experiencing within this limited area now this reality and you are
1:08:21 awareness of this reality this moment next moment again you are aware of the reality next moment again you are aware
1:08:27 of the reality like this from moment to moment from moment to moment from moment to moment without any without any
1:08:34 disturbance if you keep on observing the reality from moment to moment this may
1:08:39 change this Sensational that sensation but you are within this area and the reality that is manifesting here from
1:08:46 moment to moment from moment to moment how long you continue to be aware without any Interruption that much is
1:08:52 your samadi stronger and stronger and it is Sama right because you are with the
1:08:58 reality that you experience no imagination is involved a mind can get
1:09:03 concentrated with an imaginary object a shape or form of this God or that God
1:09:10 this goddess or that goddess founder of this religion or that religion you can imagine the shape or form of this face
1:09:17 of this person keep on repeating it this imagination mentally mentally your mind get concentrated or you keep on working
1:09:23 with the word keep on repeating it verbalization verbalization might get concentrated this is not the natural
1:09:29 reality you see the Sheila that you practiced is to take you to the second
1:09:34 step of samadhi and the samadhi that you are practicing is to take you to the third step of
1:09:40 PA it is all Progressive moving towards the final goal so if you take any other object
1:09:49 which is either imaginary or it is your own creation you impose something which is not there then
1:09:57 it will not take you to the final goal so object should be whatever comes up within this area and you're aware you're
1:10:03 just aware moment to moment moment to moment you are aware you are aware you are aware how long you are aware
1:10:09 continuously keeping the attention within this limited area is s samadi
1:10:15 otherwise mind can get concentrated with they said ignorance
1:10:20 this imaginary objects or with the base of greed ra or with the base of Aion
1:10:31 do you would have seen a hunter fully concentrated on his double
1:10:37 barrel gun a prey coming and he will shoot and kill concentration is there
1:10:42 but this is not Sama samadi a cat standing near the mouse
1:10:49 hole fully concentrated the mouse comes out and jumps and devours
1:10:55 fully concentrated not samadi every unome physical action or
1:11:02 vocal action is done with some some amount of samadi concentration even a
1:11:08 pick pocket picks your pocket mind is concentrated very aware what he's doing
1:11:14 or she is doing this is not sadii it must be free from craving free
1:11:20 from Aion when you were observing your breath you were free from MOA ignorance the truth that you are experiencing
1:11:28 there is no confusion about it the breath is there the touch of the breath yes the touch of the breath is there and
1:11:34 now these Sensations the sensations are there and you're observing and you're not observing with craving or with
1:11:40 aversion as with the breath there was no craving no abortion similarly with the touch there was no craving no abortion
1:11:47 similarly now the sensations that you experience here no craving no abortion things are just happening and we are
1:11:53 observing objectively objectively this makes the samadi Sama samadi and this
1:11:59 helps you to move in the next field the Third Field of PA that is wisdom that is
1:12:07 inside which will purify the mind not merely at the surface
1:12:12 level Sheila takes you to samadhi where you develop Mastery over the mind but
1:12:18 this Mastery over the mind is at the surface level slightly deeper and Pa
1:12:23 takes you to the depth of the Mind and at the deepest level the third part of dhama is to purify the mind at the
1:12:30 deepest level the so-called unconscious level the source of your misery from where all these impurities arise
1:12:37 originate and they multiply the stock of your past impurities that you accumulated all of them have to come
1:12:44 upon the surface and pass come upon the surface and pass that will be Pa we won't discuss about it today we'll
1:12:50 discuss tomorrow because Day After Tomorrow you are entering the field of PA the practice should go together so
1:12:56 tomorrow we discuss about PA so that you practice day after tomorrow now you are in the field of Sheila you're observing
1:13:02 all the precepts that you have taken very meticulously very scrupulously and you're practicing your samadi awareness
1:13:08 of the reality within this limited area from moment to moment from moment to moment make use of the
1:13:15 time make use of the opportunity with a good base of Sheila living in this
1:13:21 environment in a camp a meditation camp like this there is no reason there is no
1:13:27 uh reason that you should break any of the Sila and you got all the Tranquility the calm calmness the good atmosphere
1:13:34 around you where you can work work with your samadi make use of this the time is
1:13:39 very important the opportunity that you have got is so good for you the facility that
