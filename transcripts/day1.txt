0:08 the first day is

0:37 diligently ently
0:44 patiently but persistently
0:50 continuously it is your own hard work which will give you the best fruits
0:58 of your stay here nothing
1:05 else your own hard
1:10 work from morning 4 4:30 till night 9
1:16 9:30 you to keep on working very
1:23 diligently
1:28 continuously of course every evening from 1 to 1 and 1/2
1:35 [Music] hours there will be these Tama
1:43 talks and understand they are not for any kind of an intellectual
1:51 entertainment they are just for you to understand the
1:57 technique what it is how you to
2:08 work without understanding the technique although you may work very hard very
2:15 diligently but you may not work properly and if you don't work
2:22 properly you can't expect the results the good
2:28 results that every one gets by practicing this
2:34 technique so these evening talks are to
2:40 understand how this technique wants you to
2:46 work and then work
2:54 accordingly you started your work
3:01 observing respiration the incoming
3:07 breath the outgoing breath as it comes in
3:14 naturally as it goes out
3:21 naturally this is not a breathing
3:28 exercise you are not supposed to control your breath not supposed to regulate
3:33 your breath this is not the practice of what
3:39 is called [Music] pranayama where it is necessary to
3:44 regulate the breath different
3:53 techniques have different peculiarities specialities
4:01 we are not here to condemn other techniques but while you are here to
4:07 give a fair trial to this technique you are here to give full Justice to this
4:13 technique you must understand the speciality of this
4:19 technique the peculiarity of this technique and adhere to this peculiarity
4:27 and work exactly as this this technique wants you to
4:32 work don't try to regulate your breath natural
4:39 bread if it is deep you aware it is deep if it is shallow you are aware it
4:46 is shallow if it passes through the left nostril you are aware it is passing to
4:54 the left nostril if it passes to the right nostril you just aware it is passing
5:01 through the right nostril if it is passing through both the nostrils simultaneously you're just
5:08 aware passing through both the nostrils simultaneously that's
5:17 all don't interfere with the natural flow of the bread let the nature play
5:22 its own role and your role is just
5:27 observe just obser observe the reality as it
5:33 is not as you would like it to be but as it
5:42 is this is the speciality of this technique you start by observing the
5:50 breath as it is pure breath bare
5:57 breath nothing else but
6:06 bre I know with the experience of thousands of students who come to the
6:14 courses that the first day is a difficult
6:23 day some complain about pains in the leg or ache in the
6:29 back or headache or this discomfort or that
6:35 discomfort natural one basic reason is
6:45 that your body and your mind both have become prisoners of their own
6:53 habit pattern of life now we are doing something
6:59 to which they are not accustomed so they start resenting they
7:06 start revolting the body starts revolting I don't like it the mind starts revolting
7:15 I don't like it so you feel very uncomfortable
7:23 natural but that is one reason a minor reason the major reason of your
7:28 discomfort is this technique itself because you started working
7:35 exactly as this technique wants you to work these
7:41 difficulties discomforts inconveniences have started manifesting
7:48 themselves because you started observing natural breath normal breath bare
7:57 breath nothing but breath
8:05 there are many techniques where along with the awareness of the
8:11 breath you are asked to recite any word mentally recite a
8:17 word a mantra a phrase keep on repeating it mentally
8:23 keep on repeating it mentally mental verbalization
8:29 it helps I know with my own experience because I have passed through
8:36 that Pro process and I also heard from many others who have this
8:43 experience and therefore I accept it that if you add some word and start
8:51 repeating it any word along with the awareness of
8:56 breath your mind calms down
9:01 easily it gets concentrated
9:07 easily similarly there are techniques where along with the
9:13 awareness of the breath one is asked to
9:19 visualize imagine a shape a
9:25 form a shape or form of this God or that God God is founder of this religion or that
9:33 religion in whom you have great deep respect and
9:39 devotion you keep on imagining that shape that form and again you will find that your
9:47 mind is getting concentrated concentrated easily your discomforts are passing away
9:54 passing away mind is quietening
10:00 becomes more and more tranquil gets more and more
10:06 concentrated knowing this with my own experience and also the experience of so
10:12 many others and yet I say don't use any
10:19 verbalization don't use any visualization just observe the breath
10:26 bare breath nothing but bread
10:31 why there must be some valid reasons for that and there are valid
10:37 reasons to understand that first it should be
10:43 clear as to what is the goal of this technique of
10:48 meditation what is the aim if the aim of the meditation was to
10:56 get the Mind concentrated to calm down the chattering
11:01 mind well certainly one must use some kind of verbalization or some kind of
11:09 visualization or imagination nothing
11:14 wrong but so far as this technique is concerned concentration of the
11:22 Mind quietening the mind is just an
11:27 aid a means this is not the final
11:34 goal the final goal is to purify the
11:41 mind and purify the mind not just at this surface level but purify the mind
11:48 at the deepest level the root level to change the behavior pattern of
11:55 the Mind the present Behavior pattern
12:01 which keeps on remaining agitated agitated all the
12:06 time something unwanted happens in the life and they keep on
12:16 happening one starts tying knots starts building up
12:22 tensions starts generating negativities something wanted does not
12:28 happen in the Life some obstacle has
12:34 come and again one starts tying kns building up tensions starts generating
12:41 negativities anger hatred ill will animosity etc
12:47 etc dying kns dying kns all the time one has become a bundle of knots
12:54 Goran knots so
13:00 tense the entire physical structure so tense the entire mental
13:07 structure so tense at times at the surface
13:12 level you try to relax try to relax your body try to relax your mind it is
13:19 helpful but you never know that at the level there's a constant tension going
13:27 on constant agitation going on because constant tying of Nots is
13:36 going on constant generating of negativity is going on that makes one so miserable so
13:46 miserable how to come out of this misery this technique will help
13:53 you to go to the depth of the reality of your mind and matter structure
14:00 and realize the truth about it and understand at the experiential
14:07 level how and where you started generating
14:14 negativity how and where you started multiplying the
14:20 negativity that means you started generating your misery and started
14:25 multiplying your misery you must go to the source of your misery
14:31 then only it will become possible for you to come out of this habit pattern
14:36 where out of ignorance you don't want to remain miserable you don't want to multiply your misery and yet you remain
14:43 miserable and yet you keep on multiplying your misery because you are ignorant what is happening deep inside
14:49 you don't know this technique will help you all the saints and sages and Sears
14:59 of the past have said know
15:05 thyself know thyself they became
15:12 Saints because they knew themselves they pass through the process
15:18 of exploring the truth about oneself no thyself not merely at the
15:25 intellectual level that won't help no thyself at the actual level that
15:32 means the experiential level what is this to which I say I I
15:42 I this corporeal physical bodily
15:50 structure this mental structure the combination of the
15:57 two is this
16:03 tremendous amount of attachment towards this physical structure the mental
16:09 structure by identifying oneself with it as I
16:16 I and the resultant misery when you identify yourself with
16:21 the matter and the mind and you develop attachment towards it
16:30 you start becoming tense you start tying kns and the misery
16:38 starts to accept it merely at the intellectual level or even to accept it
16:43 at the devotional level because an unlighted person has said so doesn't work at the actual
16:52 level you have to explore the truth the reality
16:59 of your entire being the mind the matter from the surface level the
17:07 apparent grossest level going deeper deeper deeper subtler subtler subtler
17:14 sest level this technique will help
17:21 you to explore the truth of the entire field of metal
17:30 to explore the truth of the entire field of mind at the experiential
17:36 level if someone wants to realize the truth at the experiential level one has
17:43 to work within the framework of the body not outside so the technique will help you
17:50 to explore the reality within the framework of your own body
17:59 and respiration the breath will be a very important tool for
18:10 you pure bre be bread as it
18:19 is one reason why we do not want you to have any
18:27 verbalization or visualization is of course A minor reason but still an
18:33 important reason is that when you
18:38 verbalize you generally use a name name of this God or that God this godess or
18:45 that goddess founder of this religion or that
18:50 religion and then you get involved in a particular religion in a particular sect
18:58 and the technique wants you to
19:04 work at the level of universal truth the entire technique is free from
19:13 sectarianism Universal if you use a vision an
19:19 imaginary Vision a shape a form of this God that godess founder of this religion
19:25 that religion again you get get involved with a particular organized religion a
19:32 sect everyone cannot practice those belonging to that particular sect will practice that
19:38 way it won't be Universal understand our Miser is
19:47 universal the melody is universal when someone generates
19:54 negativity anger or hatred or ill will passion fear ego
19:59 any negativity one becomes tense becomes
20:08 miserable this applies to everyone when you generate
20:13 anger what label can you give to this angle anger that now this anger which is
20:19 a reason is a Christian anger or this is a Jewish anger or a Hindu anger or a Buddhist anger or an American anger or
20:26 an English anger or a Russian anger is anger and the misery that one
20:32 experiences because of this negativity again you can't label it a Hindu misery or a Muslim misery or a Christian misery
20:38 or Jewish misery misery is misery Universal the melody is
20:46 universal the remedy has to be Universal sectarian remedy cannot
20:53 help therefore one very important requisite of this technique is is that
20:59 every step that you take on this path from the beginning till the final you reach the final goal every step must be
21:08 with the truth the truth the truth the
21:14 truth that you experience the truth that you experience
21:20 at this moment like this from moment to moment from moment to moment whatever
21:26 truth manifest itself within the frame work of your body the truth pertaining to this physical structure the mental
21:33 structure you just keep on observing observing observing this is universal same with
21:43 everyone till you reach the final goal don't mix up with any belief or
21:51 Dogma or cult or philosophy of this tradition or that
21:56 tradition however correct they may be how true they may be the reality that you have not
22:02 experienced is no reality for you the reality experienced by an enlightened
22:08 person the Buddha or say Christ or say Muhammad is the reality for those people
22:15 not for you when you reach that stage and realize yourself it becomes a reality for you not till then so work
22:22 with the reality that you experience directly within the framework of your body from moment to moment from moment
22:31 to moment the bread that you are experiencing from moment to moment
22:38 breathing in this is the reality of this moment breathing out reality of this moment if it is deep it is deep it is
22:46 shallow it is shallow then it is a universal object not a sectarian
22:52 object you can't say the breath that is coming in is a Hindu breath or a Christian breath or American breath or a
22:58 Russian breath breath coming in breath going out the object is universal
23:04 truth if you keep on working with universal truth the technique is such it will keep
23:13 on taking you from very solidified intensified apparent truth of the
23:20 surface level and you will find how day to day as you are here for 10 days day
23:25 to day piercingly penetratingly piercingly penetratingly dividing
23:32 dissecting disintegrating dissolving you are moving towards subtler reality
23:37 subtler reality day to day you'll be moving from the gross to the subtle the
23:43 subtler the subtler and certainly this technique will take
23:49 you to the stage where you experience this Suess truth the Suess truth pertaining to the
23:56 matter at the experience exp erential level this sub truth pertaining to the
24:02 mind at the experiential level this sest truth pertaining to the mental
24:08 contents at the your experience level and then a time will
24:13 come when you explored the entire field of mind and matter you will be able
24:21 to transcend that field and experience something which is
24:28 Beyond mind and matter no words can explain what it
24:34 is it has to be witnessed to be experienced the ultimate
24:40 truth and the whole process is a process which will make you realize the truth
24:46 about your own self know
24:51 thyself the process of knowing yourself becomes a process of knowing the
24:59 law the nature the universal law of nature then you start understanding the
25:06 universal law of nature as you experience the truth within
25:12 yourself the universal law which governs the entire universe
25:19 animate inanimate which is applicable to everyone
25:25 everything that becomes so clear
25:30 this universal law punishes
25:35 us as soon as we break the law anyone who breaks the law is punished then and
25:42 there and when we start living in line with the law as the law wants us to live
25:49 this very law starts rewarding us this will become so clear exploring
25:56 the truth about yourself the physical truth the mental truth the
26:01 combination of the two the interaction going on every moment when you keep on
26:06 observing it observing it as this technique wants you to observe properly
26:12 without mixing up anything everything will become so clear the nature will starts Reve will start
26:18 revealing itself the entire law will start revealing itself the truth of the world
26:25 the universe will become so clear the the law of the universe will become so clear and then it will become so easy to
26:33 live in line with this law as the law wants us to live and the life will be
26:40 full of happiness peace Harmony not just at the
26:45 surface level of the Mind the entire being mind and matter the combination of the two will be full of Peace Harmony
26:55 happiness this is the goal of this technique not that in 10 days you will
27:01 reach the final goal but within 10 days you will Gras the technique how to work how to work to
27:10 explode the reality within yourself moving step by step step by
27:17 step always from the gross reality towards the subtler subtler
27:24 subtler without mixing anything else with it the truth as you experience from
27:32 moment to moment from moment to moment and for this to start with the
27:38 breath is a very important tool if you mix up some verbalization
27:46 with it or visualization with it as I said the concentration will become very
27:55 easy true but as your mind gets concentrated with
28:00 the verbalization with the visualization you forget all about the breath your mind gets concentrated you start
28:06 experiencing peace at the surface level of the mind then the whole process of
28:12 exploring the truth pertaining to yourself from the surface to the depth is lost because the tool is
28:20 lost pure breath be breath was an important tool with the help of which you could have gone much
28:26 deeper therefore but don't miss this tool at least at this stage later on you
28:33 will get some more tools which will help you to go deeper now breath is very important for you breath pure
28:42 breath like you want to explore the truth about your
28:47 body what one knows about one's body one may had read books on
28:55 physiology or Anatomy miten charts this or that that
29:01 doesn't mean that you know you don't know at the experiential level it is just a intellectual
29:07 game at the experiential level you know so little about your body you know
29:14 something about the external organs the limbs the eyes Etc how they work how
29:20 they function they work according to your wishes according to your desires
29:27 according to your commands if you want your eyes to get open it opens up close close your hands
29:36 raised your leg move whatever wish you have according to that these limbs these
29:41 organs outside they start working but how about organs inside the
29:48 heart the lungs kidney Li
29:55 Etc they don't work according to your wishes your desire your
30:00 command if you give a command to your heart stop eating it won't stop if you say you slow down it won
30:07 slow down if you want it to become fast it won become fast you no command over it
30:14 you no control over it what to talk of this big organs
30:20 inside entire material structure the physical structure the Corporal structure is made up of tiny little
30:28 atoms subatomic particles and every particle has some
30:33 activity or the other every moment something is happening there you are not knowing because you're not experienced
30:38 this technique will help you to experience that but you have no control
30:43 over that it is just happening
30:49 naturally oh so you know know something about this physical structure at the
30:55 surface level at the external level where things happen intentionally as well as
31:03 unintentionally but you know nothing about things which are happening inside unintentionally they're just happening
31:10 you no control over them the enlightened one
31:19 found a tool with the help of which you start experiencing the reality
31:30 within the framework of the body inside what's happening this tool the
31:36 breath like someone living on this Bank of the river more or less knows about the
31:41 reality of this Bank of the river because this person has lived there is living
31:47 there someone else crosses the river and goes to the other Bank of the river and
31:53 returns and speaks very high of the other bank oh wonderful wonderful and
31:59 one feels like enjoying it witnessing it but one sits at this Bank of the
32:06 river with folded hands Mo
32:11 eyes choking voice starts praying craving
32:18 crying oh other bank please come here oh other please come here I want to witness
32:23 you I want to enjoy you I won't come there to come here whole life this
32:30 person may keep on crying it doesn't happen can't happen the only way for someone to
32:38 witness the truth of the other bank is to leave this Bank cross the river and reach the other bank so
32:45 simple you require a bridge which connects this bank with the other bank
32:50 with the help of which you can enjoy and witness the other bank this breath works like a bridge
32:58 this known field of your physical
33:04 structure the breath is connected with the known field of the structure physical structure to the unknown field
33:11 where things are happening just naturally it connects them this is one
33:19 activity of the body which works both ways
33:24 intentionally as well as unintentionally you want to have intentional breath a
33:29 deep breath yes you can have it you want to have a shallow breath you can have
33:35 it even if you want to stop breathing maybe just for half a minute you can stop
33:41 breathing you don't give any orders or command to the breath naturally it will be coming in going out coming in going
33:47 out so it works both ways that is why you make use of the
33:53 breath and with the help of the breath you go to the other Shore the other Bank
33:59 of the reality of this physical structure and this is what you started
34:05 doing during these 10 days many more realities pertaining to
34:11 your physical structure will manifest themselves accept them only when you
34:19 experience not because of these discourses not because your teacher says so not because any particular scripture
34:25 says so not because a scientist says so not because enlightened one Buddha says so your own experience with your own
34:32 experience moment to moment moment to moment the breath will help
34:40 you and very soon you will start understanding that
34:46 the breath also help you helps you to explore the mental
34:52 field initially it will look the breath is a physical function coming in going
34:59 out but very soon you start realizing it has got so much to do with the
35:06 mind and it it has got so much to do with the mental impurities the defilements the
35:13 negativities as you practice you will start realizing then when your mind starts
35:19 rolling in any negativity anger hatate will animosity passion fear
35:25 anything the respiration the breath loses its normality it is no more normal it
35:33 becomes slightly hard it becomes slightly fast and when that particular
35:39 negativity has passed away you find the breath has again become normal your breath is strongly related
35:46 to your mind also and the mental negativi also it will become clearer and
35:53 clearer and you are here to go to the source of of your problem your
35:59 day-to-day problem that means the origin of your negativities this breath will
36:05 help you at the mental level to go to the depth of your problem where the
36:10 negativity arises it will help you to explore the
36:15 reality about your mind also at the material Level you were just
36:22 observing the whole day the breath coming in the breath going out coming in going out passing through left nostril
36:29 passing through right nostril passing through both the nostrils deep shallow whatever it is you observing it that was
36:36 you are observing the truth about the physical structure tonight tomorrow whole day you
36:43 will start experiencing the truth about the physical structure at a little subtler level deeper level it is there
36:51 all the time but you never experienced it now you will start experiencing it
36:57 understand the exploration at this stage is a small area you to explore the
37:02 reality within this limited area with the base of the upper lip covering the entire area of nostrils you are keeping
37:09 your attention at the entrance of the nostrils and the passages inside the nostrils the breath passes over this
37:16 area and you are aware of it now within this limited area see if the area is
37:22 smaller you will notice that because you're working on a smaller area your mind is is becoming sharper and sharper
37:29 subtler and subtler sharper and sharper more and more sensitive starts feeling
37:34 subtler realities if you have bigger area to work upon the Mind does not become sharp so easily that is why the
37:42 enlightened one wanted you to work on a small area after one or two days you will narrow down this area also narrower
37:49 the area of your awareness sharper the mind is bound to become mind become sharper and sharper
37:56 to feel subtler ities tonight and tomorrow you will start feeling you might have started feeling even today
38:03 you will start feeling the touch of the breath touch of the incoming breath
38:08 touch of the outgoing breath anywhere within this limited area not necessary it should touch everywhere
38:16 anywhere on the inner walls of the nostrils or maybe on the outer rings of
38:21 the nostrils or maybe on the area below the nostrils above the upper lip which
38:27 within this limited area anywhere you feel the touch you're just aware do nothing the whole technique is just be
38:34 aware just be aware if you feel a touch you are aware there's a touch if you don't feel you
38:39 don't feel you're just aware the breath coming in going out but give importance to the touch and you will notice after
38:47 tomorrow you started feeling still subtler reality and the day after still subtler reality like this you will move
38:53 from the gross reality to the subtle reality the subtler the subtler the
39:00 subtlest pertaining to this corporeal body and so also pertaining to the
39:06 mind today nobody told you to observe your mind but unintentionally you
39:12 started observing your mind you noticed what kind of mind I carrying you are asked to observe your
39:19 respiration You observe hard to respiration and gone this mind is gone
39:25 somewhere and after a long time you realize oh where it is gone I was here
39:30 to observe my breath and again you bring it again after one or two breaths gone
39:35 somewhere and again you realize you bring it back and not only that when you
39:40 find this mind wondering again and again a flickering mind you feel so agitated
39:47 what kind of mind I carrying it cannot work this ordinary work just to observe it has nothing to do respiration is
39:53 there it's not a breathing exercise that you get fatigued because of that it is there and your job is just observe It's
40:00 Just Happening you're sitting on the bank of the river the bank the river is Flowing what you have to do and still it
40:07 cannot do even this easy job you feel very frustrated you generate agitation
40:14 irritation oh no no then you are going against the technique this is the your own habit
40:21 pattern of the mind that when something unwanted happens you react you react with irritation with a agitation with
40:28 negativity and this is what you started doing now you want the mind to get concentrated and look it is not
40:34 concentrated so you start reacting oh no no no the technique wants you just
40:41 accept the effect mind is wondered away at this moment the mind is wondered away
40:47 smilingly accept it wondered away so what the breath is still there I come back to breath come back to breath again
40:54 it wanders away again come back to breath very soon you will realize that as soon as you accept the fact the mind
41:00 has wandered away you won't have to pull it back to the breath it just comes it will come automatically you just accept
41:07 the fact mind has wandered away enough it will come back to the brein so you started observing your mind
41:14 the nature of your mind it keeps on wondering what a fleeting mind a flickering mind a wondering
41:21 mind another reality where does it Wonder oh so many objects you can't keep
41:28 a diary you're not allowed to keep a diary here but even if you were allowed no not possible for anyone to keep a
41:34 diary where it wanted every moment it is some somewhere on the sky or somewhere
41:41 in another world Al together you can't keep a diary but
41:46 still carefully if you notice you will find there are only two Fields only two
41:52 fields for this mind to wonder the field of the past memory is
41:58 the field of the future a memory will arise in your mind this memory or that
42:03 memory at this moment this memory later on maybe some other memory but some memory it so happened it so happened oh
42:10 so and so insulted me in the past so and so abused me at that time I didn't know
42:15 what to do now this fellow insults me I will R like this I will reply like this
42:23 I will do like and start rolling in future and you keep on rolling in future rolling in future again suddenly a
42:29 thought of the past comes and you start rolling in the past again you jump to the Future and you keep on rolling in
42:34 the future ah this is the Habit pattern of my mind it keeps on Rolling in the
42:42 past or rolling in the future it does not want to live in the present does not
42:48 want to live in the present and one has to live in the present how can you live in the past the past is gone
42:55 forever you cannot buy back the moment that has gone away you cannot buy back
43:01 it and relive giving all the dollars of the world impossible it's gone forever and future is future unless it becomes
43:08 present you can't live you have to live in the present and look what sort of mind which
43:15 does not want to live in present oh that is the reason why it remains so agitated
43:22 it does not know the art of living and the whole technique teaches you the art
43:27 part of living how to live in the present moment even a few moments you get when you are with the respiration
43:34 this is the moment the reality of this moment the breath coming in the breath
43:39 going out and all other moments when you were rolling in the past or in the
43:44 future was the result of the Habit pattern of the Mind another reality will become clearer
43:51 and clearer well it wonders in the past it wonders in the future what kind of
43:58 thoughts again two kinds of thoughts two patterns Pleasant
44:05 unpleasant when it rolls in the past Memories the memory may be pleasant memory or unpleasant memory when it
44:12 rules in future the thought of the future may be pleasant or unpleasant so either it is Pleasant or it is
44:19 unpleasant then you will notice that when it is when it has started rolling in something pleasant of
44:25 the past or the future then a part of the Mind started reacting
44:31 I like it how wonderful this should happen again and
44:36 again oh wonderful wonderful this liking liking it turns into craving craving and it
44:45 turns into clinging clinging and you don't know how you lost the balance of your
44:50 mind you become unbalanced you become miserable because you started craving
44:55 you started clinging similarly when the mind starts rolling in a thought unpleasant of past of
45:02 future you will notice a part of the mind will start reacting I don't like it
45:08 I don't like it and this don't like it don't like it very soon turns into Aion
45:14 hatred and again you notice you lost the balance of your mind you become very
45:19 agitated ah this is the present Behavior pattern of my mind it keeps on reacting
45:26 with craving clinging avorion hatred which in the language of the days of
45:32 Buddha was Raga craving means and D Aion so all the time craving
45:40 abortion craving abortion therefore all the time
45:46 agitated why this craving why this avorion because one does not know what
45:51 is happening deep inside a surface level of the Mind remains busy with the outside of objects and one does not know
45:59 the depth of the Mind where craving arises where abortion arises where agitation arises where Miser arises this
46:06 is what is called ignorance M and also moha ignorance the mind is so
46:15 ignorant at times you will notice how ignorant the mind
46:21 is a thought arises in the mind past or future doesn't matter Pleasant or unpleasant doesn't matter a thought has
46:27 reasen in the mind and before even one sentence is over some other thought has
46:33 started and before one sentence is over some other thought has started irrelevant
46:40 thoughts there is no sequence of thoughts and this is madness what else Madness can be when
46:48 you say somebody insane person a mad person this person is mad this person is insane because this person has no
46:54 sequence of thoughts an example an insane person hungry from last 4
47:02 days you feel compassionate you offer him a plate full of food very happy he
47:07 sits down because he's hungry he takes just one Morel of the food and before this moral ditches the mouth his thought
47:15 pattern has changed now starts thinking I'm in a bathroom I'm taking bath and
47:21 this is a soap cake starts rubbing it on his body and before that is over another
47:27 thought starts coming this person who has come is my enemy and he has come to
47:32 kill me and before he kills me I should kill him and how to kill him oh these
47:37 are the hand grenades I throw and he will be dead throws away whole foot this
47:43 is a mad person insane person he's got no sequence of thought everyone will
47:49 realize how insane one is you got no sequence of thoughts one
47:56 thing starts and then suddenly something else will start and then suddenly something else will start Madness and
48:01 this is called MOA ignorance one ignorance that you don't know what is
48:06 happening one ignorance that there is no sequence of your
48:12 thought well even if there's a sequence of thought you don't know how you
48:17 generating negativity in your mind and how you're generating misery this will become clearer and clearer at the
48:23 experiential level as you go deeper as you go deeper the interaction of the mind and the
48:29 matter will become clearer clearer clearer and you to work for that work in
48:36 the way that this technique wants you to work then the work will become
48:44 easy not to condemn any other technique whatever you were practicing in the past
48:49 don't condemn it you were involved in rights or rituals or religious ceremonies don't condemn but for these
48:55 10 days you come here to give a fair trial to this technique to get best result of your 10 days to give 10 days
49:02 of the life for a householder is not easy multifarious responsibility of the
49:08 householder and to leave all that aside and then just come here to explore what is this breath and what is this body and
49:14 what is this mind what's the purpose a very important purpose which helps you
49:21 to learn The Art of Living how to live peacefully and harmoniously
49:27 peace and Harmony within and how to generate nothing but peace and harmony for others now when you generate
49:34 negativity you become miserable everyone who generates negativity bound to become
49:40 miserable and one does not keep this misery limited to oneself when you generate negativity and
49:47 become miserable you start throwing this misery on others you make the entire
49:52 atmosphere around you so tense anyone who comes in contact with with you at that time becomes tense becomes
49:59 miserable this is not the proper way of life the art of life is missing and we
50:07 PNA will teach you the art of Life a way of life a proper way of life
50:13 a code of conduct how to live peacefully and harmoniously within and how to generate nothing but
50:20 peace and harmony for others and that is possible only when you explore the truth of of the nature
50:27 the nature the present nature of your your own mind and matter the nature of
50:32 the law of the universe all that has to be experienced then you will find a change has started coming in you a
50:39 change for better for which you to work hard and
50:44 for that there are certain important advises some warnings for you so that
50:53 you make best use of your next nine days one very important thing
51:00 is that this is a very serious job that you're doing it is actually a deep
51:06 surgical operation of your own mind deep surgical operation and when you do deep surgical
51:14 operation very deep rooted complexes start coming up on the surface natural when you cut open the
51:22 wound the P starts coming up the surface it is for your good but the whole process of cutting the
51:29 wound and taking the P out is unpleasant you to face it accept it
51:38 bravely I have to cut open the wound to take out the p and every unpleasant
51:44 experience that you have bear it smilingly because it is for your good as
51:49 I said the discomforts that you started experiencing today is a part of the
51:55 game your started making the operation of the Mind the wound is cut and the P
52:00 started coming up on the surface and you to face the music now face it face it smilingly you have to
52:09 face example back in the
52:15 East when a housewife prepares food they use the fire place using
52:22 charcoal the burning charcoal the food is is cooked and now this this fire is not
52:30 needed and they want to use this charcoal again for the next cooking to extinguish the fire they take
52:36 handful of water and throw on those burning charcoals the nature of that
52:42 charcoal hot so hot burning hot nature of this water so cold as they come in
52:50 contact this cold this H great impact great reaction
52:57 and there is a great reaction CH there's a sound of CH comes there you throw
53:04 another handful of water again CH you keep on throwing handful of water ch ch
53:11 ch till the temperature of the charcoal has come in line with the temperature of
53:16 your water it is no more hot then you may throw a bucket full of water no so
53:22 understand this is of your body that moment maybe you're working for one hour
53:28 you will have maybe one moment when your mind is just with your breath coming in going out reality of this moment there's
53:36 no ignorance this is the truth there's no imagination involved and no craving no aversion when a breath is coming in
53:42 you don't start craving I want more breath more breath it is there no he craving and when the breath is going out
53:48 you don't start saying I don't want breath I don't it is going out to come back it goes out to come back you just
53:53 remain equanimous you just observe that particular particular moment when your mind is just equanimous observing the
54:00 truth as it is without ignorance with the reality without craving without
54:06 abortion is a wonderful moment that moment part of the mind is so pure but
54:13 still you got so much garbage deep inside and all that impurity and
54:19 negativity that you accumulated at the depth of your mind this purity of this moment comes in contact with that
54:25 impurity big explosion volcanic explosion a big Chun and that comes up the surface a
54:32 pain in the leg and plane in the back pain in the head oh so much discomfort oh so much discomfort I better run away
54:40 this is not good for me and all those things B to come make a strong
54:47 determination this is the operation of my mind when you have a physical operation
54:54 the operation is performed by a surgeon outside or somebody else and you are kept in anesthesia you
55:01 don't know what's happening but here you have to make your own operation no
55:07 anesthesia and you have to face everything that comes up now be brave face it it is for your good that is how
55:15 you start changing the behavior pattern of the Mind face it and develop the strength of the mind
55:24 because no Anastasia is involved you to develop this quality strength of the
55:30 Mind One strength of the mind is that I will observe all the rules the
55:36 regulations like you enter a hospital all the rules of the hospital you have to
55:42 accept similarly you have come to your hospital don't say mental hospital you
55:48 have come to your hospital to some extent yes you are here to purify your mind make it a healthy mind you have to
55:55 observe all the rules all the rules one rule is 10 days you are in a prison you
56:04 can't go out you can't go out people who come to the course before they join the
56:09 course they are asked are you prepared to stay for 10 days and when they come
56:15 to the course again they are shaken are you prepared look read these rules sign
56:20 up are you prepared and then again somebody gives a small talk are you prepared you have to stay for 10 days
56:28 and yet with the experience of so many people and so many courses we find not all but some who are a bit weak-minded
56:35 as the first day goes the operation is started the second day there's agitation
56:41 one feels like running away oh this is not good for me some other time I'll come some other time and wants to run
56:49 away no then again on the fourth day another deep operation starts and the fifth day goes Deeper by
56:57 the time when is the sixth day again this agitation will start in the case of some I want to run away I want to run
57:04 away the second day the sixth day maybe on some other days too but the second
57:09 day the sixth day big agitation face them face these agitations bravely with
57:15 a determination I am here for 10 days I have to take out this garbage from deep
57:21 inside all the puss of my wound should come out it is unpleasant but it is good for me I will face it as you go to your
57:28 hospital where very surgical operation of the body is going on you have half the operation then you
57:34 say the surgeon no no no enough now I'll come again and have it operated nothing doing the surgeon won't allow so also
57:40 the surgeon here won't allow no teacher will allow you in the midst of the course to go away so have a
57:46 strong determination that I won't go away let anything another strong determination
57:52 that I will abide by all the rules especially the timetable
57:58 I'm supposed to be in the hall at 8:00 a.m. I must be here couple of minutes earlier 8 a.m. I am sitting cross leg I
58:07 started my meditation you come gossiping talking lingering seeing here seeing there and
58:14 this 10 minutes late 15 this doesn't work 8:00 8:00 you must start at 8 time
58:19 is very important every minute is so so precious for you and
58:24 then meditation period you to meditate 8 to 11 meditate not that now there is
58:31 time I I set for 1 hour enough now let me wash my cloth let me take a bath let I do this this oh nothing doing
58:37 meditation period meditation period strong determination another strong
58:42 determination three times a day morning 8 to 9 afternoon 2:30 to
58:48 3:30 and evening 6: to 7 you are in the hall let anything happen I make a
58:56 determination I won't go out of the hall I may keep on changing my posture doesn't matter later on after 3 4 days
59:03 you won't even change the PO posture don't get frightened by that now now at this stage you can change the posture
59:09 but remain in the hall this will give you the strength of the mind your determination helps you a strong
59:16 determination another warning that you are asked
59:24 to lie down take rest whenever you feel very tired in your residential quarters
59:31 you take rest you are lying down and you are told not more than 5
59:36 minutes you feel so comfortable lying down and you say why 5 minutes perhaps
59:43 this restriction is for ignorant persons I'm quite smart I don't feel drowsy I
59:49 know I'm aware of my respiration so what 10 minutes so what I'm aware of my respiration I'm a very smart chip all
59:54 right 15 minutes you feel drowsy 20 minutes half an hour you start snoring
1:00:01 snoring and then somebody else in your dormet finds you are snoring ah
1:00:07 wonderful I to lie down snoring snoring the whole dmetry will become full of
1:00:13 snoring dormet the whole Camp The Meditation Center will become snoring Meditation
1:00:19 Center you are here to remain awakened alert all the time every moment not more
1:00:26 than 5 minutes sit more and more work in a sitting post more and more work in a sitting
1:00:32 posture another risk another danger work inside at this stage work
1:00:41 indoors if you sit and meditate outside in the open sun with open air not
1:00:48 healthy later on of course a Buddha becomes Buddha sitting under a tree open
1:00:53 Tree open sky but that requires lot of maturity in meditation at this stage if
1:00:59 you sit outside during meditation hours the breeze that touches your
1:01:05 nostrils or the area below the nostrils will not allow you to feel the subtle Touch of your own
1:01:11 breath so don't sit outside during recess period is all right or even with
1:01:16 closed eyes there is a light on your eyes closed eyes and you can't go deeper because of that so always work
1:01:23 inside that is a very important thing for you you and then another
1:01:30 danger now staying here for 24 hours you have come to know that there is no
1:01:36 dinner no dinner here and 11:00 when you are in your queue for your lunch then
1:01:42 you think of your dinner no dinner here I'm accustomed to take one full plate in my lunch one full
1:01:49 plate in my dinner and I'm not getting dinner here I better take my dinner now two plates one for the one for the lunch
1:01:57 and my teacher keeps on saying you to fight out your own battle you to fight out your own battle I must be physically
1:02:03 strong to fight my batt three plates dangerous you can't meditate
1:02:11 impossible if you are accustomed to take one full plate in one meal take three
1:02:16 quter one quarter of your stomach should always remain empty 24 hours then you
1:02:22 can M it better don't feel it overfilling is out of question don't feel it keep one quarter of the stomach
1:02:28 empty this will help you another
1:02:33 warning complete silence is very important very
1:02:39 important you have seen your mind working for one day what a chatter box it is keeps on chattering chattering
1:02:46 chattering and then you start talking to somebody else of course if you got any problem pertaining to technique you
1:02:51 always free to come and discuss with the assistant teachers any real problem pertaining to management you can have a
1:02:58 few words with the management but amongst yourselves not talking no communication even at the level of
1:03:04 glances or gestures just remain within yourself that the reality within yourself is so
1:03:10 important for you you have been EXT overed the whole life now you learn how to observe the truth inside if you start
1:03:17 communicating with the fellow student then you started creating problem for you this chattering mind
1:03:25 gets some more food for chattering you talk with somebody and then you sit for meditation all those thoughts will keep
1:03:30 coming in your mind and they will churn your mind and so many thoughts related or unrelated which start coming up it
1:03:36 becomes a problem for you not only a problem for you a problem for that person also with whom you talk when you
1:03:43 talk you can't talk with the air you can't talk with the walls you can't talk with the trees with whomever you talk
1:03:48 this a meditator and you give some more chattering food to this person also all right you keep on chattering for some
1:03:54 time you created problem for others you created problem for others other meditators two of you start chattering
1:04:01 and that noise disturbs so many students no talking complete silence and you will
1:04:07 know the benefit of this silence this silence is also important
1:04:13 for another reason yesterday I took about five precepts very easy to observe
1:04:22 other precepts not to kill not to steal not to have any sexual activities Etc
1:04:29 but not to speak lies whenever you speak because of the old habit you may exate
1:04:36 you may hide something and you have broken one of your Sheila out of those five Foundation
1:04:42 Stones even One Foundation is shaken your meditation will become weak don't
1:04:48 do that silence complete silence and you will notice it is of much help to you
1:04:54 very much help another very important thing don't mix up anything with this
1:05:00 technique you surrendered yourself to this technique for 10 days after 10 days you are your own Master but for 10 days
1:05:07 you surrendered yourself don't mix up anything with it I read something there
1:05:13 in this way VNA these people say VNA is like this these people say Satan is like
1:05:18 this or my tradition says meditation of this type or this verbalization this visualization this imagination why not
1:05:24 do little bit of and little bit of this dangerous very
1:05:30 dangerous it is risky an example someone is accustomed to ride a white horse his
1:05:35 own right White Horse and he gets another Black Horse and somebody says you just try this black horse this
1:05:42 is very good horse and you say yes I will try but I won't leave my horse one
1:05:48 leg on my horse and one leg on your horse and let me try dangerous one is accustomed to travel in
1:05:56 his own boat in her own boat somebody offers another boat very convenient his
1:06:02 fast boat good boat all right I'll try it but one leg in my boat and one leg in your boat more dangerous more
1:06:10 dangerous much more dangerous is one leg in this technique and one leg in the other technique for 10 days don't do
1:06:18 that just work exactly as you asked to work for your own safety we have seen
1:06:24 cases in spite of repeated warnings repeated warnings someone ignorantly doesn't
1:06:31 listen and then gets entangled in a situation where even the teacher finds it difficult to take this person out of
1:06:38 the danger so don't do that unintentionally something starts you can't help there was your past practice
1:06:46 say with a word verbalizing or visualizing and because of the past habit it starts happening along with the
1:06:52 breath and when you realize you say oh no no verbalization in this technique no visualization and you come out of it
1:06:59 again it starts again you come out of it nothing wrong no danger but intentionally you start mixing up then
1:07:06 it gets so much churn deep inside it will create difficulty don't take any
1:07:12 risk and also don't take any risk of moving outside the demarcated
1:07:18 area there is a meditation area this a big Center so keep within this limited
1:07:24 area for your safety and see that you make use of every
1:07:29 moment the remaining nine days are so important if you work as you are asked
1:07:34 to work on the 10th day you will start realizing that yes these 10 days were
1:07:41 really remarkable days of my life but that can happen only when you were make
1:07:46 best use of the time make best use of the opportunity make best use of this
1:07:53 facility and make best use of this wonderful technique the wonderful dhama so
1:07:59 scientific so non sectarian so rational make use of it for your own good for
1:08:07 your own benefit to come out of the bondages the shackles the chains of
1:08:13 ignorance of craving of avorion to enjoy Real peace real Harmony
1:08:21 real happiness may all of you enjoy Real
1:08:27 peace real Harmony real

1:09:12 m s
1:09:29 [Music]
1:09:35 [Music]
1:09:54 a few words of explanation for the benefit of new
1:10:01 students just now you noticed and you will be noticing again
1:10:06 and again where you heard heard me chanting three times these three words Batu Sab
1:10:18 mangang and the old students giving the response saying
1:10:23 sadhu sadhu sadhu don't take it as a right or a
1:10:30 ritual understand what it
1:10:36 is according to the technique of Vash as one keeps developing in
1:10:44 it whenever one performs any wholesome action which is good for oneself and
1:10:51 good for others at the physical level or vocal level or mental
1:10:57 level when one finishes that particular wholesome action one develops love and compassion
1:11:03 and good willll for Others May this wholesome action of Mind result in the
1:11:10 good of others so bat sa mang may all be
1:11:15 happy may all be happy may all be happy then those who
1:11:22 listen they also generate and div this quality of love compassion and
1:11:28 Goodwill and with that love and compassion and Goodwill for others they respond sadu oh well said well done we
1:11:36 are also with your good wishes we also want may all beings be happy if you
1:11:41 develop this kind of positive feeling of love compassion for others then say sadhu sadhu sadhu otherwise not don't
1:11:50 make it a right or ritual now you may take rest for about 5 minutes and the then you start again
1:11:56 take rest for about 5 minutes
