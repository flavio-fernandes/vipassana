0:09 the eighth day is
0:13 over you have only two more days
0:19 left out of these two only one day to
0:23 work
0:25 seriously even one day is good enough
0:30 if one really works works
0:35 seriously works exactly as the technique
0:38 wants you to
0:41 work you get so much
0:47 benefits another important
0:52 thing keep on understanding the
0:55 technique
0:57 properly so that even going back
1:02 home you will make use of this technique
1:04 properly you will practice
1:06 properly you will apply it in life
1:11 properly otherwise even if you work hard
1:13 and work seriously and you don't work
1:17 properly the benefits that you should
1:20 get by this technique you will be
1:24 missing keep on
1:27 understanding two important aspect of
1:30 the
1:31 technique both are equally
1:36 important
1:38 awareness and Equanimity they go
1:43 together like two wings of a
1:47 bird they must be equal in size and
1:50 equal in
1:51 strength otherwise the bird cannot
1:55 fly like two wheels of a bullock card or
1:58 the horse card
2:00 they must be equal in size and equal in
2:03 strength otherwise they won't
2:07 work so both are equally important
2:10 awareness as well as
2:14 Equanimity if you are
2:18 aware and you're not
2:20 equanimous the purpose is not
2:23 served you are
2:25 equanimous but not aware of the
2:27 sensations the purpose is not
2:32 if you are aware of realities
2:35 outside gross apparent reality it is
2:38 good but this is not
2:41 weer even the gross reality pertaining
2:44 to your physical structure your mental
2:47 structure physical structure all the
2:49 activities of the body you are
2:51 aware mental structure some
2:54 very solidified gross emotion comes in
2:58 the mind and you are aware
3:00 it helps but this is not the teaching of
3:03 the enlightened
3:06 one he wanted you to work with the
3:08 sensations on the
3:12 body there were
3:14 teachers before
3:17 Buddha there were teachers contemporary
3:20 to
3:21 Buddha they were teachers after Buddha
3:25 also and nearly all of them unless
3:29 someone was someone who was involved in
3:32 any kind of immoral activity
3:36 otherwise every real sent person will
3:39 advise the same
3:41 thing the objects of your are sense to
3:45 don't react to these objects of the
3:47 sense to the shape the form the color
3:50 the light the sound the smell The Taste
3:54 the touch the thought they may be
3:57 pleasant they may be unpleasant don't to
4:00 them don't generate craving don't
4:03 generate
4:05 aversion this one not something
4:08 new given by gamad
4:12 Buddha this was not his
4:15 Enlightenment his Enlightenment was to
4:18 go to the depth of the
4:21 problem everyone else was giving
4:24 importance to salatan the six sense
4:28 stores and and their
4:32 objects as if the craving and the
4:34 aversion arises because of these objects
4:37 of the six sense stes which at the
4:39 apparent level is
4:42 true but his Discovery
4:48 was six Sense come in contact with the
4:52 respective six
4:54 objects
4:57 and with this cont
5:00 starts sensation on the body Pleasant or
5:02 unpleasant
5:05 and you are craving your aversion starts
5:09 after you started experiencing the
5:11 sensation on the body that link was
5:16 missing so people kept on practicing to
5:19 come out of craving to come out of
5:21 abortion but it was all at the surface
5:23 level the root was never touched they
5:27 didn't realize that they to go to the
5:30 level of the sensation on the body to
5:32 take the root of the impurities out this
5:35 was the contribution of kadi Buddha to
5:39 the mankind to come out of their misery
5:42 from the depth level and if we miss this
5:45 then awareness is not complete awareness
5:48 awareness of the sensations on the body
5:52 and equinity towards the sensations
5:54 Pleasant or unpleasant these are the two
5:56 wheels of this card these are the two
6:00 wings of this
6:02 bird both must be equal in size and
6:05 equal in strength for your
6:10 progress you started observing your
6:14 respiration and observing respiration on
6:16 a small
6:18 area when he wanted you to do this there
6:21 was a meaning behind it if you work on a
6:23 bigger area then mind will not become
6:26 that
6:27 sharp then only the mind will feel
6:30 very gross sensation here very gross
6:32 sensation here some pain here some
6:34 pressure here some heat here but can
6:37 never become sharp the smaller the area
6:41 the smaller the area of awareness
6:43 sharper the Mind becomes more sensitive
6:46 it becomes and by the time you reach the
6:49 third day you started feeling Sensations
6:51 here you further narrowed it down and
6:53 you felt sensation on this area it
6:55 became easy for you to feel Sensations
6:57 everywhere
7:00 this is a very important station of the
7:03 path of
7:04 Liberation one has to reach this station
7:08 where one feels Sensations everywhere
7:12 Cross or subtle but everywhere no part
7:15 of the body should remain blind or blank
7:18 that means without any sensation
7:20 sensation is there all the time
7:22 everywhere but your mind should become
7:25 sensitive enough to feel them very
7:28 important station but you can't do
7:30 anything you can't force that it just
7:32 happens naturally your job is to keep
7:35 moving stay where there is no sensation
7:37 stay for a minute keep moving stay for a
7:39 minute very patiently very patiently you
7:42 find your mind is becoming subtler and
7:45 subtler is becoming more and more
7:48 sensitive and it starts feeling
7:51 everywhere second important station
7:54 again very important
7:56 station the dissolution of the entire
7:59 structure mind and matter it turns into
8:02 mere vibrations vibration he called it
8:05 Banga Banga me dissolution total
8:08 dissolution again you can't do anything
8:11 let it happen naturally you keep on
8:13 observing your mind becomes subtler and
8:16 subtler sharper and sharper more and
8:18 more sensitive automatically the law of
8:21 nature is
8:22 such the solidified intensified gross
8:25 Sensations they start getting divided
8:28 dissected dis integrated divided
8:30 dissected disintegrated and they start
8:33 getting dissolved dissolved
8:35 dissolv that is bang you start getting a
8:38 free flow of very subtle vibrations
8:41 throughout the
8:42 body it's a very important
8:45 station and
8:47 yet he says it is a very dangerous
8:51 experience dangerous in the sense that
8:54 having come through all the unpleasant
8:56 gross solidified sensation suddenly you
8:59 come to this very pleasant flow very
9:01 pleasant flow of
9:03 vibration according to the old habit
9:06 pattern of the mind you start developing
9:09 craving and clinging for it oh so
9:11 wonderful and he says this is the danger
9:14 very big danger one can remain
9:17 equanimous with the unpleasant ones
9:20 expecting that they will pass away and I
9:22 will start experiencing subtler ones as
9:24 others have started
9:25 experiencing but when the subtler one
9:28 come One get so much attached to
9:32 it this is a stage very very frightening
9:35 he
9:36 says very dangerous one has to be very
9:40 cautious not to develop any attachment
9:43 to this Pleasant sensation otherwise the
9:45 progress will stop and not only progress
9:48 will stop stop regress will start
9:51 because you will start generating now
9:53 craving craving clinging clinging and
9:56 whenever you miss and this present
9:59 sensation flow of subtle vibration is
10:02 not Eternal it comes it goes away again
10:06 some very deep rooted shankara which
10:08 otherwise would not have come on the
10:09 surface because you started feeling a
10:11 free flow of subtle vibration because
10:14 you reached the stage of total
10:15 dissolution then only very deep rooted
10:17 shankara will come on the surface which
10:20 might be of the type a very gross nature
10:23 and you start feeling again gross
10:24 Sensations unpleasant Sensations and you
10:27 feel so depressed you start feeling I am
10:29 regressing I had such a wonderful
10:31 sensation and now look it's missing and
10:33 now I'm again with this unpleasant
10:35 sensation you are not understood them
10:38 properly you started playing games of
10:42 Sensations this is what one keeps on
10:44 doing the whole life a sound Pleasant or
10:47 unpleasant a sight Pleasant or
10:49 unpleasant a smell Pleasant or
10:52 unpleasant a taste Pleasant or
10:54 unpleasant a thought Pleasant or
10:56 unpleasant now similarly a sensation on
10:58 the body Pleasant or unpleasant and you
11:01 keep on reacting with craving with a
11:03 what makes the
11:04 difference you not understood
11:07 D in spite of repeated
11:11 warnings we see some students of course
11:13 few but there are who keep on taking
11:16 courses after courses courses after
11:19 courses but they don't understand the
11:21 technique they don't
11:23 understand they keep on relishing the
11:26 pleasant Sensations and they keep on
11:28 having a verion towards the unpleasant
11:30 ones they keep on playing this game game
11:32 of sensation game of sensation this is
11:35 not we not at all we have to be very
11:38 careful understand the essence of the
11:41 technique properly so that you work
11:43 properly and you get the benefit of this
11:45 technique properly unless you go to the
11:48 root level the sensation level and
11:51 unless you have Equanimity at the
11:53 sensation level whatever
11:56 sensation every sensation gross or
12:00 subtle Pleasant or unpleasant has the
12:02 same characteristic characteristic of
12:05 arising passing arising passing this is
12:08 what you have to experience when there
12:10 is a solidified intensified gross
12:13 sensation then
12:15 arising is
12:17 clear but after some time sooner or
12:21 later it passes away it seems to stay
12:23 for some time it arises seems to stay
12:27 for some time and passes away when this
12:29 very intensified solidified gross
12:32 sensation gets dissolved turns into
12:36 vibration the characteristic Remains the
12:38 Same arising passing arising passing now
12:41 with great rapidity as it arises so it
12:43 passes as it arises so it passes with
12:46 great velocity great frequency
12:48 characteristic Remains the Same this
12:51 characteristic must be very clear clear
12:54 in your mind look it is changing
12:56 changing changing and therefore no
12:59 craving no abortion no craving this is
13:02 how you change the Habit pattern of your
13:04 mind otherwise deep
13:07 inside this process of
13:09 multiplication shankara after shankara
13:12 every moment you generate some shankara
13:14 or the other because Sensations are
13:16 there every moment so long as one is
13:19 alive every moment there is some
13:21 sensation or the other and the deepest
13:24 level of the mind is constantly in touch
13:27 with these Sensations whether you are
13:29 asleep or you are awaken 24 hours it is
13:32 in contact with the Body Sensations like
13:35 you are in deep sleep and you say in
13:37 deep Sleep it is only our conscious mind
13:38 which which has gone in deep Sleep the
13:41 so-call unconscious is always conscious
13:43 of the Body Sensations always conscious
13:46 a mosquito has come and beaten the
13:48 unconscious the so-call unconscious
13:49 immediately feels unpleasant sensation
13:53 drives away the mosquito kills the
13:54 mosquito still unpleasant sensation is
13:56 there will scratch and rub and like this
13:59 whole night mosquitoes will come bite
14:01 come bite and you won't know your
14:03 conscious mind won't know that shows
14:05 there a big barrier between the
14:06 conscious and the unconscious similarly
14:09 when you are awakened your unconscious
14:11 mind will be busy with objects outside
14:14 at a very gross level but the
14:16 unconscious the so-called unconscious is
14:18 the conscious which remains all the time
14:20 busy with the outside object the
14:22 unconscious is constantly in contact
14:24 with the body sensation and it keeps on
14:26 reacting there's a pressure somewhere it
14:28 react
14:29 there's a pain somewhere it reacts
14:31 there's itching somewhere it reacts that
14:33 reaction is continuous that has become
14:35 the Habit pattern of your unconscious
14:37 mind unless you change this habit
14:40 pattern at the deepest level you're not
14:42 coming out of your misery not coming out
14:44 of your Mis you just trying to amend the
14:48 the branches the
14:50 Twigs the the leaves the flowers the
14:53 fruits of the tree but the root is
14:56 decaying is unhealthy so long as the
14:58 root is unhealthy
14:59 your tree can never become healthy your
15:02 conscious mind can never become healthy
15:04 so long as the unconscious remains
15:06 unhealthy so Buddha found out that we
15:08 have to work with the deepest
15:10 unconscious level of the mind this is
15:12 what you started doing if this point
15:15 remains in your mind all the time that I
15:17 have to work with the deepest level of
15:19 your mind there are many other
15:21 techniques many other kinds of
15:22 meditations we are not here to condemn
15:24 them but so far as this technique is
15:26 concerned straight away it starts
15:28 working with the depth of the mind and
15:30 if you miss that depth of the Mind our
15:33 purpose is not served because the
15:35 process of multiplication continues Sara
15:37 after Shara every moment you generate a
15:39 Sara of craving or aversion craving or
15:41 aversion and all the time a Sara of
15:43 ignorance ignorance you don't know what
15:45 is happening this is misery every
15:47 Sankara is a misery multiplication is
15:51 there in the outside world
15:53 also in the world of
15:56 vegetation this process of
15:57 multiplication multi multiplication is
15:59 there so also deep inside process of
16:02 multiplication multiplication is there
16:05 and there is a way to stop this
16:07 multiplication and change this habit
16:11 pattern like outside world a small
16:15 seed seed of a banan tree in tropical
16:18 countries we have a very huge tree ban
16:21 tree very tiny seed size of a
16:24 CMM this small tiny seed contains this
16:29 huge ban tree you plant it a tree comes
16:32 out which grows so huge and it stays for
16:37 centuries very long
16:39 life one seed has started giving
16:43 fruits every season hundreds upon
16:46 hundreds of fruits and so many centuries
16:49 fruits after fruits millions of fruits
16:51 one seed
16:53 only how a long life this tree may have
16:56 a time will come when it will be become
16:59 old will Decay will die fall down no
17:03 more
17:04 fruits at the apparent level one may say
17:07 that one seed has given millions of
17:10 fruits but after all the story ended the
17:13 story does not end the multiplication
17:17 continues understand how it
17:20 continues the seed that one planted and
17:24 this huge banan tree fruits it started
17:26 giving the law of nature is such
17:30 you don't have any fruit which does not
17:33 contain the seed of the same quality one
17:35 or more every fruit will contain seed
17:39 and again this seed contains a huge Bion
17:41 tree and millions of fruits millions of
17:45 seeds and every seed has got a huge Bion
17:47 tree oh endless process of
17:50 multiplication endless process of
17:53 multiplication but nature has also
17:56 helped to understand that how this
17:58 process can be
18:00 stopped it is true every seed every seed
18:04 has one huge ban tree but this seed
18:07 requires a fertile soil it requires
18:11 water it requires
18:14 fertilizer
18:16 manure you throw it on a rocky rocky
18:19 land it can't grow ban tree cannot come
18:22 out of it but our difficulty is that
18:26 these seeds of shankaras
18:31 millions of millions of them are coming
18:33 because of our seed that we planted once
18:35 so many are coming now and we keep on
18:38 giving good fertilizer to every seed
18:40 that comes keep on giving very fertile
18:42 soil to them oh my shankara you keep on
18:45 growing oh my misery you keep on growing
18:48 you keep on growing you keep on
18:50 growing what ignorance this is what one
18:53 keeps on
18:54 doing like one carries a tank full of
18:58 gasoline petroleum one spark comes from
19:01 outside comes in contact with it and a
19:04 big explosion huge
19:07 explosion thousands upon thousands of
19:09 new
19:11 sparks without understanding that every
19:14 spark that you generated now will bring
19:18 hundreds and thousands of Sparks in
19:20 return and then again Every Spark that
19:22 comes you'll be giving all that gasoline
19:25 again multiply multiply multiply
19:29 at the intellectual level one
19:31 understands this multiplication is so
19:34 dangerous for
19:35 me I should not generate shankaras every
19:39 Sankara is so harmful every Sankara is
19:41 multiplication of my misery and yet it
19:44 is merely an intellectual understanding
19:47 unless you practice properly at the
19:49 level of sensation you can't come out of
19:52 it one knows very well somebody is
19:54 bringing fire towards me to burn me
19:58 the best thing is that I keep
20:01 my water hose ready when he comes I open
20:05 my water hose and extinguish the fire
20:07 immediately that one understands at the
20:10 intellectual level but at the actual
20:12 level somebody's bringing
20:14 fire I open my petrol pump burn burn I
20:19 throw a bucket full of petrol over it
20:21 you burn I burn both of us burn and
20:24 later on you realize that was so wrong I
20:26 should not have done that when fire was
20:29 brought towards me I should have used
20:30 water to extinguish it not the
20:33 petrol and you go to your God Almighty
20:36 to this God that god goddess and pray I
20:39 made a mistake please excuse me I made a
20:41 mistake next time the same mistake next
20:45 time the same mistake you're not coming
20:46 out of it it doesn't help because you
20:49 don't know what is happening deep inside
20:51 deep inside there is always this
20:53 volcanic eruption always this negativity
20:56 the the reaction of negativity
20:59 and you can't come out of it unless you
21:01 start observing the sensations on the
21:03 body you to feel the sensation one
21:06 important part of the technique you must
21:08 make your mind so sharp so sensitive
21:10 that you feel the sensations and another
21:12 part of the Mind another part of the
21:14 technique remain equanimous remain
21:17 equanimous don't react don't react keep
21:20 on understanding this is a nature this
21:23 is a nature and this is not a false
21:26 belief don't accept because Buddha said
21:28 so don't accept because the tradition
21:30 says so with your own experience you
21:32 find things arise sooner or later they
21:35 pass away they arise they pass away they
21:36 arise they pass away when everything
21:38 gets dissolved then arising and passing
21:41 is with great rapidity but the same
21:43 technique the same reality arising
21:45 passing arising passing is there it is
21:47 an it is impermanent it is impermanent
21:50 and like this you start changing the
21:51 Habit pattern at the deepest level of
21:54 your mind that is very important when us
21:56 to understand this
21:59 law of nature is such that once you stop
22:03 generating new
22:04 Saras the old ones will start coming up
22:07 on the surface and get eradicated you
22:10 remain equanimous they will come on the
22:11 surface you remain equanimous they come
22:13 on the surface they become weaker weaker
22:15 weaker and get evaporated this is law of
22:20 nature this is what was realized by this
22:22 unlighted person this was his Discovery
22:25 when he said
22:29 the chain link theana the Mind
22:33 Consciousness the consciousness of the
22:35 mind every moment it arises passes away
22:38 arises passes away and the nearest cause
22:40 of this is shankara every time you
22:43 generate a shankara the vyana of the
22:45 next moment the consciousness of the
22:47 next moment arises again you generate
22:49 Sankara the Consciousness arises next
22:51 moment mind of consciousness of the of
22:53 the Mind arises next like this this
22:55 process goes on goes on at the end of
22:58 the life very strong shankara will raise
23:00 its head and give a strong push and
23:02 shankara and the vyana arises in another
23:04 body and it continues continues
23:06 continues this truth was realized how to
23:10 stop it so long as you keep on
23:13 generating shankaras this flow will
23:15 continue continue you stop generating
23:18 new shankara the reverse process will
23:20 start
23:22 automatically an
23:24 example this flow of mind and matter
23:28 this is the flow of the life mind and
23:31 matter for the life of the matter for
23:34 the flow of the matter you to give some
23:37 material food with the help of this
23:40 material food it continues continues
23:43 continues so also for the flow of the
23:46 Mind a mental food has to be given the
23:49 Sankara has to be given then only it it
23:52 continues continues
23:56 continues say one day you not Tak any
23:58 food you fasted you
24:01 fasted and yet the flow of Life
24:05 continues you decide 2 days
24:08 fasting it continues 5 days 10 days one
24:13 has fasted for 1 month 2 month
24:16 ultimately the body dies because this
24:19 the food you sto giving food for so long
24:22 you stopped giving food for so long then
24:25 why it took so many months to die
24:28 because the old stock was there whatever
24:31 accumulated you have fats Etc it started
24:33 consuming that when that was also
24:35 consumed there was no more food atached
24:39 the same principle for the flow of mind
24:43 you keep on giving shankara for the food
24:46 of the body if you give even once in 24
24:48 hours it is good enough to sustain it
24:51 but for the flow of mind every moment a
24:54 food must be given the feeding must go
24:56 every moment every moment and by this
24:59 technique you learn you don't give a
25:01 food this moment you're not given a food
25:03 you just experienced you smiled
25:06 Ana neither craving no Avion no
25:08 ignorance you are just aware and not
25:10 reacting no
25:12 Sankara still the Mind flow has not
25:14 stopped next moment next moment again
25:16 you not given any any Sara next moment
25:19 again you not given any Sara and yet it
25:21 continues continues same principle how
25:23 it continues with your old stock of
25:26 shankaras when you're not
25:28 given when you're not given a new
25:30 shankara for the flow of the life old
25:33 one has to come on the surface it comes
25:35 on the surface and a new vyana arises
25:38 again you're not given any shankara old
25:40 one will come on the surface and new
25:42 vyana arises and like that it flows
25:44 flows flows when all the shankaras are
25:46 consumed then you are out of it you're
25:48 liberated from all the miseries this
25:51 principle is there but only by
25:54 experience one starts understanding how
25:56 the old ones come on this surface you
26:00 generated a Sankara of
26:01 anger you will find the sensations all
26:04 around are very unpleasant sensation
26:06 because a biochemical reaction has
26:07 started and because of this unpleasent
26:10 sensation because of this biochemical
26:12 that has started flowing again you
26:14 generate anger new shankara you
26:16 generated again this biochemical gets
26:18 generated and there is unpleasant
26:20 sensation and because of this unleas
26:22 sensation again you generate anger and
26:24 this Vicious Circle this is what is
26:26 multiplication of your misery
26:28 continuously continuously continuously
26:31 Sankara after Shara shankara after
26:33 shankara you generated anger and as
26:36 result of that some biochemical reaction
26:38 has started very unpleasant sensation
26:39 has started you don't
26:42 react again it continues for some time
26:45 you don't react you don't react you
26:47 don't react the Habit pattern starts
26:49 changing to change the Habit pattern one
26:51 has to go to the depth of the sensations
26:54 and don't react and you find how it
26:57 starts clearing away clearing the stock
27:01 like example is
27:02 given yog got
27:04 fuel a heap heap of
27:08 fuel burning
27:10 firewood and there is fire it is burning
27:13 as it is burning you throw some more
27:15 firewood on it it is burning you throw
27:18 more firewood the new firewood that you
27:20 are giving to it the fire starts
27:22 consuming the new one and the old one
27:25 remains deep inside layers after layers
27:27 it goes increasing and the new one comes
27:29 and the new one comes you stop giving
27:32 new fuel the fire is consuming sooner or
27:35 later it will consume the whole thing
27:37 and you'll be out of
27:39 it people understand it in different
27:42 ways how the old ones get eradicated the
27:45 fact is it gets eradicated how it gets
27:49 eradicated a research scientist of this
27:52 part of the world came to my
27:55 teacher about 30 years ago
27:59 he was a friend of my friend so common
28:02 friend he came he learned that in BMA
28:05 there is a technique and there is a
28:07 teacher who teaches
28:09 you to come out of the Habit pattern of
28:12 negativity and live a peaceful life
28:15 harmonious life all the accumulated
28:18 defilements of the Mind get eradicated
28:19 by this technique and being a scientist
28:21 he wanted to examine it how how it
28:23 happens he
28:25 came my teacher normally a new student
28:29 is not given more than 10 days course
28:32 but somehow he made a decision that this
28:34 is a reserving case gave him a longer
28:37 course straight away and 10 days
28:40 Ana he was working on that and reaction
28:43 started so strong reaction at times he
28:46 will see that he's jumping about 6 in
28:49 from the floor while he's meditating and
28:51 my teacher keeps on smiling one day he
28:54 tells me you go and see how he is
28:57 meditating in the cell each individual
29:00 has got a meditation cell through the
29:02 lures I see and I see that he's standing
29:04 on his shoulder and whole body is
29:06 shaking as if he is possessed possessed
29:09 by some ghost what's happening I went
29:11 and told my teacher what's happening and
29:13 he smiled and he laughed he said let it
29:15 happen good it's good for
29:18 him and he carried on and later on WE to
29:22 know that he is the research scholar
29:26 of sky
29:29 craft he is discovered and
29:34 made
29:37 Continental ballistic missiles with
29:40 nuclear heads such a person what kind of
29:44 shankara creating hell forli of people
29:47 to die what kinda it has to come that my
29:51 teacher is smiling let it come let it
29:53 come at the end of the course he feels
29:55 so light so happy it's Wonder
29:59 wonderful and my teacher says good all
30:01 that stuff came out and you're lighter
30:04 now he say I am lighter this is the fact
30:07 I feel happier this is the fact but I
30:10 can't understand that my impurities my
30:12 defilements of the Mind came out of
30:14 these Sensations how can I accept it my
30:17 teacher laughed said good don't accept
30:20 Buddha also used to say don't accept
30:22 don't accept just because I say so don't
30:24 accept because the tradition says so the
30:26 scripture says so you keep on
30:28 experimenting yourself and when you
30:30 understand with your own experience and
30:32 you find that yes this is true and this
30:34 is good then only accept it and he went
30:36 back
30:37 home and he writes a letter after a few
30:41 days that this meditation has given me
30:44 so wonderful result I was such a
30:48 short-tempered person so much of tension
30:50 in me always having very cross relations
30:53 with those who were working under me or
30:54 my superiors and even didn't have very
30:58 good relationship with with my wife now
31:01 everything is
31:02 changed and I understand not that
31:04 everything is changed I am changed a big
31:06 change has come in me and I find
31:08 everywhere it is so good it is so good
31:12 yet I cannot understand what these
31:14 Sensations have got to do how my
31:16 impurities went by sensation I'm a
31:18 scientist how can I accept it after a
31:20 few years he came again worked again for
31:23 a long course and going back home he
31:25 writes a long letter with a big
31:29 arle is a metallurgist specialist in
31:32 purifying the metal the metal used in
31:35 the spacecraft
31:36 Etc he says we have got a principle a
31:40 theory a particular metal has to be
31:42 purified it must be Ultra Pure even one
31:45 particle one molecule in a million
31:48 molecule should not be a foreign
31:50 molecule it must be 100% pure Ultra
31:54 Pure and for that we melt it
31:58 then we take out a ring which is 100%
32:01 pure and this hot ring we pass over this
32:05 this Rod like shape of the this metal
32:07 which we want to purify and this ring
32:10 because it is pure it develops some kind
32:13 of magnetism and it starts pulling out
32:16 all the impurity from this Rod all the
32:19 molecule even one in a million cannot
32:21 stay it has to go out invisibly and the
32:24 molecules which are there they are in so
32:26 much order it gets so much strength oh
32:29 this is what Buddha found out this ring
32:32 of pure Consciousness moving from head
32:34 to feet and feet if this ring is not
32:36 pure it doesn't work if this ring is
32:39 reacting craving Aion craving Aion it
32:41 doesn't work but because it is pure it
32:43 is not reacting no craving no abortion
32:45 it keeps on purifying this is his way of
32:48 understanding different people
32:50 understand in their own way but the fact
32:52 is that it does purify somebody comes to
32:55 me and tells me well there is a
32:58 principle of this batteries with charge
33:00 battery we keep on charging charging
33:03 charging it gets charged charg charg we
33:06 stop charging we do nothing and it
33:08 starts getting discharging discharging
33:10 automatically we do nothing for
33:11 discharge we just stop charging oh this
33:14 is also one
33:16 principle somebody comes and tells me
33:18 you see this toys where where you have
33:22 these you you you twist
33:25 the you wind you keep on winding winding
33:27 winding and then you leave it and the
33:30 toy will dance something and then
33:32 unwinded unwinded automatically for
33:34 unwinding you do nothing you just keep
33:36 on winding and Buddha gave one example
33:38 like you have a rope two ends of the
33:41 Rope you keep on twisting twisting
33:42 twisting twisting and suddenly leave it
33:45 it will get opened up this is law of
33:48 nature you stop generating new Saras the
33:51 old one are bound to get eradicated you
33:54 keep on multiplying you keep on
33:56 generating new Sara after new
33:58 the process of eradication cannot start
34:02 there is always a process of
34:03 multiplication multiplication that means
34:05 process of your misery multiplied every
34:07 time the Sankara is Multiplied every
34:10 time your misery is
34:11 Multiplied so simple to understand and
34:14 yet so difficult people forget it and
34:17 they keep on generating shankara after
34:19 shankara Misery after misery misery
34:21 after misery this is what one has to
34:23 learn be aware of the sensations
34:28 and don't react to the sensations the
34:30 awareness of the sensations and not
34:32 reacting to the sensations so simple
34:35 this is the technique you miss this and
34:37 do anything else then the result will
34:39 not be there you be with it and the
34:42 result are bound to be there little by
34:44 little little by little your own
34:46 experience will say that like a ordinary
34:50 housewife she buy some soap or some
34:52 detergent the dirty linen is there you
34:54 use the soap the dirt goes away it is
34:57 not the job of that housewife to see
34:59 what chemical was there in this soap
35:01 which went against the dirt and how it
35:03 was purified this is the job of the
35:05 research Scholars the scientist let them
35:07 do but for a ordinary person the misery
35:09 is there the suffering is there because
35:11 of this habit pattern of generating
35:13 shankaras after Sankara you stop
35:15 generating Sankara and you find you are
35:16 coming out of your misery your habit
35:18 pattern is changing people who are very
35:20 much addict of their anger they coming
35:22 out of their anger addict of passion
35:23 they come out of their passion addict of
35:25 any kind of impurity they start coming
35:27 out of it the result is
35:29 there so the proof is there because you
35:32 experience it and you accept it only
35:34 when you start experiencing the truth
35:35 the result which is good for you and
35:38 this is what the whole life he kept on
35:41 teaching this is what he kept on
35:42 teaching Equanimity Equanimity your
35:45 Equanimity inside must manifest with
35:49 Equanimity outside Equanimity inside in
35:51 your daily life now Equanimity should
35:53 come Equanimity should come visites of
35:56 life will be there
35:59 the teaching was not merely for monks
36:01 and for nuns it was equally for the
36:03 householders number of householders used
36:06 to come to him one group came and told
36:09 him sir we are not prepared to become
36:10 monk or to become none we have to live
36:13 with
36:14 householders will the technique work for
36:16 us can we also get liberated surely
36:19 technique is technique for all when
36:21 becomes a monk or a nun then there are
36:24 no responsibilities of life one can give
36:25 whole life for this purpose and and the
36:27 result come earlier but as a householder
36:29 there are multifarious responsibilities
36:32 and with all those responsibilities you
36:33 can't give that much time so it takes
36:35 little longer but it works even for the
36:38 householder and he gave a sermon for the
36:40 householders how the technique works for
36:42 the
36:43 householder all the responsibilities of
36:46 a householder one has to look after all
36:48 the responsibilities if you are a
36:49 householder you don't run away from your
36:51 responsibility your responsibility
36:53 towards your family members towards the
36:54 society towards your relatives all that
36:57 you are performing well performing well
37:00 at the same time you are practicing you
37:02 are practicing and he gives 32 welfare
37:06 of a family Family Man family woman how
37:09 to acquire those
37:11 32 benefits of
37:14 T One Superior than the past Superior
37:17 than the past and like that when he
37:19 comes to the last highest one he says
37:39 [Applause]
37:42 [Music]
37:47 this is the highest beud of Life what is
37:53 it when you come in contact with the
37:57 visites of Life ups and downs and
38:00 everyone has to come in contact with
38:02 visites of
38:05 life and your mind does not get shaken
38:09 it remains firm
38:11 balanced a you don't start crying you
38:15 don't
38:16 generate unhappiness in your mind V you
38:19 don't generate any impurity in your mind
38:23 K you don't generate a feeling of
38:25 insecurity in your mind you always feel
38:27 secured you're on the path of dhma
38:28 nothing can go wrong this is the highest
38:31 beatitude Equanimity with all the
38:34 vicissitudes of Life all the visites of
38:37 life especially when unpleasant things
38:40 are happening in the
38:41 life it is easy enough to be pleasant
38:46 when the life flows along like a sweet
38:52 song but the man
38:55 worthwhile is a man with a smile when
38:58 everything goes dead
39:01 wrong and everything goes dead wrong so
39:04 many times in our life everything goes
39:06 dead wrong everything goes dead wrong
39:09 yet you have to smile not like a actor
39:11 or the actress smile from inside because
39:14 the Sensation will be there very
39:16 unpleasant Sensation will be there and
39:18 you smile at the sensation you are also
39:21 an IT you also an it let me see how long
39:23 you last and this is what the Buddha's
39:26 teaching is law of nature is remain
39:29 equanimous in every situation all the
39:31 visites of the life and you find
39:35 wonderful even in his own life whatever
39:38 he was practice preaching he was
39:40 practicing himself in his own life even
39:42 an enlightened person has to pass
39:44 through visites of Life ups and downs
39:46 are bound to
39:50 come he started teaching this T to five
39:53 of his friends
39:55 companions which spread to 50 we spread
39:58 to 500 to 5,000 and like this started
40:02 spreading spreading spreading nearly the
40:04 entire population of Northern India
40:07 started practicing this in his lifetime
40:09 people get
40:11 benefit some remained very much against
40:14 him partly because they didn't
40:17 understand what this person is
40:18 teaching they thought perhaps he's
40:20 teaching something against our religion
40:22 our tradition and our religion will get
40:25 finished by his teaching and partly
40:28 because it was a question of livelihood
40:30 for them they were
40:32 priests and his teaching people start
40:34 following his teaching there is no more
40:36 rights rituals religious ceremonies
40:38 nothing you just observe yourself and
40:40 purify yourself and live a healthy life
40:42 happy life what the what these rights
40:44 and rituals will do and if there are no
40:47 rights and rituals they will miss their
40:49 livelihood so opposition was
40:52 there how to stop his
40:55 preaching there was one way in those
40:57 days there used to be big debates public
41:00 debates and lot of hooliganism was there
41:03 gism was there people will come with
41:05 large number of their followers and
41:07 shout and there is no actual debate it's
41:11 more aism but still that was popular
41:14 there and if somebody is defeated then
41:17 his teaching people won't accept so they
41:20 will come to fight with him to
41:23 debate but when they come to the gate of
41:26 his asham
41:27 they start scratching their head he's a
41:29 very intelligent person how to debate
41:31 with him not easy even rism because he
41:34 answers so
41:36 calmly let us make our points how to
41:38 discuss what to debate and let one of us
41:41 will be a leader you be a leader you be
41:42 a leader somebody says all right I'll be
41:44 a leader let's jot down all the points
41:46 jot down all the
41:48 points you don't carry long matted hair
41:52 on your head yes yes in those days all
41:55 the Hermits they used to have matted
41:56 hair on their head
41:58 you don't have long mustach or beards
42:00 yes long mustach beard you don't have
42:03 the Garland of beards around your Rosary
42:06 yes yes you don't wear a skin of a deer
42:10 animal around your waist yes yes you
42:12 don't smear ashes on your body yes yes
42:15 then suddenly somebody says all these
42:17 questions have already been raised and
42:20 whenever people raise this questions he
42:21 smiles he say I don't like it you like
42:24 it you carry on I'm not quarreling with
42:26 you you if you like it I don't like it
42:29 how can you quarrel with somebody that
42:31 it doesn't do let us find out something
42:34 wrong in his practice and his teaching
42:37 all right tear this away new list what
42:40 is he preaching and what is he
42:42 practicing he preaches Sheila morality
42:45 and he practices morality how can we
42:47 argue on that morality is wonderful if
42:50 somebody living the life of morality
42:52 teaching others to live a life morality
42:54 we can't quarrel what else he's teaching
42:56 some and what is samadi Mastery over the
42:59 mind master over the mind I could not
43:02 get Mastery over my mind I've been
43:04 trying so many years if somebody has got
43:05 a technique which makes you the master
43:07 of your mind it is wonderful how can you
43:09 fight no what else he's teaching PA what
43:12 PA a process by which all the impurities
43:14 of the mind go away impurities go away
43:17 my impurities are not going even little
43:19 if impurities go away wonderful how can
43:21 we fight on this point no what else
43:24 nothing else he doesn't talk anything
43:26 else he he says I teach and I practice
43:28 only Sheila samadhi PA Sheila samadi PA
43:33 all other things your beliefs your
43:36 dogmas your philosophies are Beyond me I
43:39 got nothing to do with them you carry on
43:41 whatever you like but these three are
43:43 important this is the essence of
43:45 T they go because they can't
43:48 argue but somehow something should be
43:50 done so that his preaching gets
43:53 stopped and one
43:55 way find out some Scandal if there's no
43:58 Scandal create a
44:00 scandal and for a monk what Scandal
44:02 there can be only two types of
44:04 scandals money or
44:07 woman money we can't create a scandal of
44:10 money because he has left all the
44:13 householders life as a prince all the
44:15 luxuries and keeps nothing with him but
44:19 woman yes something can be done because
44:22 men and women both come to learn dama
44:24 from him so they trained one Young
44:27 beautiful
44:28 girl every evening she will go to the
44:30 asham of Buddha sleep under a tree with
44:33 very heavy make makeups and all and next

46:35 mind by the harmony of his mind by the
46:37 Peace of his mind not by
46:40 quarreling you can never be successful
46:43 this he practiced in his life so many
46:47 situations came in his life and he kept
46:49 his mind so calm so tranquil so pure so
46:52 harmonious good for himself good for
46:55 everybody one more incident an old
46:59 Brahman he was very
47:00 angry that this fellow Buddha is

47:08 stopped these rights rituals ceremonies
47:11 and they sit in a corner and do this
47:12 respiration respiration sensation what
47:14 they doing he will spoil all of
47:17 religion I must
47:19 go and see that I open his skull this is
47:22 the only way to stop his teaching and he
47:25 goes there very angry comes nearer
47:28 abusing abusing abusing Buddha says old
47:31 man you seem to be very very agitated
47:34 come sit let us discuss your problem he

47:41 person the moment I start discussing
47:42 with him my anger will go away if my
47:44 anger goes away I can't open his skull I

48:33 intelligent person only this small ve
48:37 curtain of ignorance which did not allow
48:39 him to understand the truth this curtain
48:41 got broken and she he started
48:44 understanding how is it the whole life

49:09 observe sensation observe sensation you
49:11 must observe yourself unless you observe
49:14 yourself you can't come out of this
49:15 problem this is a big problem for
49:17 everybody this bad practicing practicing
49:21 became an fully enlightened person and
49:24 whole life kept on serving people kept
49:26 on serving people
49:27 people the whole technique is such that
49:31 unless you learn Equanimity at the depth
49:34 of the mind your Sensations are there
49:36 you can't expect the results and when
49:39 you work it that way Sensations are
49:41 there and your equanimous sensation
49:43 anything happening outside will bring a
49:45 sensation in the body Pleasant or
49:46 unpleasant anything that happens outside
49:49 will bring a sensation in the body and
49:50 if you're equanimous with that sensation
49:53 then whatever decision you make is a
49:55 healthy decision what ever action you
49:57 take is a healthy action it is not that
50:00 this technique will make you inactive it
50:02 will make you very active not that I a
50:06 meditator now like a vegetable let
50:08 anybody come and cut me I don't care no
50:13 no full of life active life the life of
50:17 reaction will go away and reaction is
50:19 always full of negativity full of misery
50:22 now action action will be positive good
50:25 for you good for others this change will
50:28 come and many times you will have to
50:31 take very strong action vocal physical
50:34 very strong action but deep inside the
50:37 mind will be full of love full of
50:41 compassion whereever strong action is
50:44 necessary one has to take like an
50:46 example a child is running towards fire
50:49 or towards a poisonous snake for the
50:52 child this is some toy to
50:54 play you can't allow you use all your
50:57 force and keep the child away the child
50:59 will be crying the child won't like it
51:01 but you have to keep the child away
51:03 there is no anger towards the child
51:05 there's only compassion there's only
51:07 Goodwill you want to help the child but
51:10 you have to use the strength like a very
51:12 strong person an
51:14 aggressor is harming a weak person an
51:16 aggressed person and you say I'm a
51:19 meditator I don't care they suffer for
51:21 their own karmas no D won't teach you
51:23 that you will take very strong action
51:26 you will stop this aggressor from taking
51:28 this wrong
51:29 action if you not meditator then also
51:32 you would have taken such an action very
51:34 strong action against the aggressor but
51:36 then you would have very much compassion
51:38 towards the aggressed the weaker one and
51:41 very much anger towards the
51:43 aggressor now it is different you got
51:46 compassion for the one who is weak but
51:48 you got more compassion for the one who
51:50 is aggressive ignorant person he does
51:53 not know what he's doing he's not only
51:55 harming this big person is harming
51:57 himself also he's generating so much of
52:00 negativity so much of ill will and that
52:02 is that goes against him it doesn't
52:05 understand and he's so ignorant he
52:07 doesn't understand the soft
52:09 language we have to use hard language
52:11 this is what he understand this is the
52:13 only language you understand you have to
52:15 take hard action very strong hard action
52:18 but Full Of Love full of compassion
52:20 first you have to examine yourself
52:22 whenever you have to take hard action
52:24 you have to examine yourself that these
52:25 are the sensations
52:27 because of the situation outside these
52:28 are the sensations and I'm not reacting
52:30 to sensation and this very person
52:33 against whom I'm going to take hard
52:34 action I got compassion nothing but
52:37 compassion nothing but compassion then
52:39 yes the technique started working for
52:42 you many incidents in the life of my
52:45 teacher SII
52:46 ubin at
52:48 times he used to take very hard action
52:52 and sometimes those who were not very
52:53 close to him they will doubt what sort
52:56 of a personal teacher he is sometimes he
52:59 shouts so
53:01 strongly how is it but those were very
53:03 close it was so clear to us when he
53:07 shouts there is no trace of anger and
53:09 yet it appears as if he's very angry
53:11 deep inside only love only
53:14 compassion of course he was a very
53:16 strict disciplinarian even in his office
53:19 when he was working with the government
53:20 and so also with the center whatever
53:23 rules are there discipline is there
53:25 every student must must work according
53:27 to discipline because the purpose of
53:30 one's coming here is to learn and
53:32 develop develop in D if one is not
53:34 working properly then no use so at times
53:37 he'll be very
53:39 strict there are meditation cells
53:42 somebody will come out to the meditation
53:43 cell and start walking here and there he
53:45 will question hey what you doing say sir
53:48 it's so happened it's so happened I came
53:50 out all right I go back after some time
53:52 again he comes out hey what happened and
53:54 again some some excuse
53:57 and when he find this fellow is not
53:58 working according to discipline then
54:00 sitting in the Hall he will say I have
54:03 to use some harsh words for this person
54:06 let me go down and the cells are just
54:08 about five or six steps below and he
54:10 goes there knocks the door and he shouts
54:14 and this is the shout of a great Vias
54:16 Master this like earthquake the whole
54:19 vasna Center starts like trembling
54:23 shouts and then comes up those four five
54:26 steps smiling and laughing going shouted
54:28 on this fellow I shouted what kind of
54:32 shout is this so much of love so much of
54:36 compassion so in life many times one has
54:38 to take hard decisions because the
54:40 person does not understand any other
54:41 language hard decisions but always love
54:46 always compassion always Goodwill if
54:49 there is even a trace of ill will you
54:51 started harming yourself how can you
54:52 help others if you can't help yourself
54:55 you can't help anybody
54:57 first you have to help yourself be
54:59 strong to help a weak person if you are
55:02 lame you can't support another lame
55:04 person if you are blind you cannot show
55:07 path to another blind person first get
55:09 yourself very healthy help yourself
55:11 first and then you will start helping
55:14 others Buddha said there are four types
55:17 of people I see in this world one group
55:20 of people like running from Darkness
55:23 towards
55:24 Darkness another group of people running
55:28 from brightness to
55:30 Darkness third group of people running
55:32 from Darkness towards brightness and the
55:34 fourth group of people running from
55:36 brightness to
55:38 brightness he never gave any sermon in
55:44 mysticism the teaching is so clear so
55:47 whenever he said something which people
55:49 may take different meaning he explained
55:51 it immediately what is Darkness what is
55:53 brightness how one keeps on running from
55:55 one to the other the first group from
55:58 Darkness to
55:59 Darkness someone is full of misery in
56:02 different ways healthwise MoneyWise
56:05 familywise Society wise all around there
56:08 is misery misery
56:09 misery this is Darkness life of Darkness
56:13 there is no happiness at all and
56:17 yet every moment this person is
56:19 generating nothing but anger hatred
56:21 anger hatred I am in this position
56:23 because of that so and so because of so
56:25 and so because of so and and so anger
56:27 towards so and so hatred towards so and
56:29 so ill will towards so and so darkness
56:31 is already there and one is planting
56:34 seed of Darkness misery is already there
56:37 when is planting seeds of misery this
56:40 anger hatred ill will will bring nothing
56:42 but misery nothing but misery so his
56:44 future is also full of misery present is
56:47 misery future is misery present is
56:49 Darkness future is
56:51 Darkness second person running from
56:54 brightness towards Darkness
56:56 brightness is quite happy MoneyWise
57:00 family wise healthwise Society wise good
57:03 status and
57:05 everything but Madness such a ego
57:08 centered life such a self-centered life
57:10 hating everybody else they are all
57:13 useless fellows I so smart that's why
57:15 I'm so happy I got so much money
57:17 position power status hating everybody
57:21 so now he is happy because of some past
57:23 good karmas of the past he has got
57:25 everything Pleasant around but every
57:28 moment the seed that he is planting is
57:30 seed of misery misery so from brightness
57:34 this person is running towards Darkness
57:36 from brightness to Darkness third person
57:39 exactly same as the first person there
57:41 is Misery all around but there is wisdom
57:44 inside one keeps on smiling oh this
57:47 misery has come because of some past bad
57:50 karmas of mine let me settle my account
57:52 I carry on my
57:57 somebody seems to be a reason of my
58:00 misery certainly this person is not the
58:02 reason of my misery he has just become a
58:04 vehicle my misery was bound to come
58:06 through this person or through some
58:07 other person so he generates only love
58:09 and compassion towards such person he's
58:12 planting seed of Love of compassion now
58:15 there is lot of Darkness but future is
58:17 brightness brightness sooner or later
58:19 this Darkness will go and then only
58:21 brightness will come the planting of the
58:22 seed now is seed of brightness it will
58:25 bring brightness will bring happiness
58:26 and the fourth from brightness to
58:30 brightness all the facilities of the
58:32 life are there money wise healthwise
58:34 Society wise family wise but keeps on
58:38 understanding there's wisdom all this is
58:40 because of some good karmas of the past
58:43 and however Good Karma I might have done
58:45 they are not Eternal the fruit is not
58:46 Eternal going to stop so now what I'm
58:50 doing now I must make use of all this
58:52 money position power status that I have
58:55 for the good of of others for my
58:58 maintenance for the maintenance of those
58:59 who depend on me and then for the good
59:01 of others for the good of others so all
59:04 the time is generating love compassion
59:06 Goodwill love compassion Goodwill all
59:08 his actions vocal physical mental are
59:11 for the good of others good of others he
59:13 planting seed of brightness from
59:15 brightness he's running towards
59:16 brightness from happiness he's running
59:18 towards
59:20 happiness we should not remain in the
59:23 first or the second category you must
59:26 must remain in the third or the fourth
59:28 third or fourth we can't decide at times
59:31 the life will be full of Darkness
59:32 because of the past karmas at times the
59:34 life will be full of brightness because
59:36 of the past karmas but we are the master
59:38 of the present
59:40 Karma Buddha
59:45 said you are your own Master nobody else
59:49 and you are the master of your future
59:51 nobody else at least whatever happened
59:54 in the past happened in the past but now
59:56 you should not generate a single Sankara
59:59 which will bring misery for you you are
1:00:01 your master if you are Master of the
1:00:03 present future is nothing but the child
1:00:06 of the present you be Master of the
1:00:08 present and see that your present is
1:00:10 full of dhma future will automatically
