2:17 you come out of your misery like this
2:19 you keep on examining

2:51 teacher and see what mistake you making
2:55 if you really practicing you should
2:58 practice some change or the other don't
3:02 expect some Miracles but some change or
3:06 the other must start change for the
3:08 better must start in the
3:13 Life anything may happen in the Life
3:16 which used to happen previously also
3:19 some unwanted thing has happened a
3:21 wanted thing has not happened somebody
3:24 has
3:26 misbehaved and you reacted
3:32 do you keep on reacting in the same way
3:34 with the same
3:36 intensity for the same
3:38 duration or some change is
3:43 coming when you reacted how quickly you
3:47 have come to senses started observing
3:50 sensation come out of your
3:52 negativity and you started generating
3:55 love and compassion for the person
3:58 against whom you started generating
3:59 negativity in the first instance keep on
4:03 examining yourself like
4:05 that maybe 10 times a similar situation
4:09 you face now as you used to face
4:12 previously quite possible nine times you
4:14 react in the same way as you used to
4:17 react before no
4:19 change once at least out of 10 times if
4:24 once you're not
4:26 reacted you start observing your
4:29 respiration your
4:30 Sensation that is a big
4:33 achievement once in 10 times this alone
4:36 will become twice in 10 times Thrice and
4:38 10 times and like this you will find you
4:41 are really progressing on the
4:46 path say a a situation as arason which
4:50 used to arise previously also and you
4:52 reacted you generated negativity you
4:54 generated anger
4:57 previously you used to roll in that say
5:00 for 8 hours continuously you kept on
5:02 Boiling Yourself 8 hours anger anger
5:06 anger now you will notice that this
5:09 boiling stops in 6 hours you start
5:12 smiling later on you find in 4 hours you
5:15 start smiling in 2 hours in 1 hour half
5:18 an hour 15 minutes 5 minutes this
5:20 duration of
5:21 period if it does not
5:24 decrease then you are as miserable as
5:26 you are before if you were miserable for
5:29 8 hours previously now you're miserable
5:32 only for 6 hours 2 hours you again you
5:34 are happy you're less miserable 4 hours
5:38 if you boil only 4 hours you are
5:39 miserable only 4 hours and like this
5:42 duration must become less less less
5:45 although you did not start observing
5:47 your respiration or sensation yet you
5:49 will find this duration becomes less
5:51 less the intensity becomes less less no
5:54 magic no Miracle no Supernatural power
5:57 comes to help you the law of nature
5:59 nature is
6:01 such if you had been playing game of
6:04 sensation for 10 days here it does not
6:08 give any good result I keep on reminding
6:11 it to the students again and
6:13 again unfortunately some are such they
6:16 keep on taking courses after courses 10
6:19 courses 20 courses someone will make a
6:21 century and yet no change no change
6:25 because one is playing games of
6:27 sensation when there is Pleasant
6:28 sensation one feel so highly elated
6:30 wonderful my meditation is so wonderful
6:34 when a gross solidified unpleasent
6:35 sensation comes one feels so depressed
6:38 oh my meditation is so bad this is not
6:41 V this is totally against
6:44 V sensation Pleasant or unpleasant makes
6:48 no difference a sensation what is the
6:51 nature of the sensation look it is a
6:53 nature it arises it passes away it every
6:56 time a sensation comes the understanding
6:58 of a nature should be there look arising
7:00 passing arising passing and with this
7:03 understanding of a nature your wisdom
7:05 increases your Equanimity increases and
7:08 this is how you are making taking
7:09 advantage of otherwise no Advantage if
7:13 one keeps on playing the game of
7:15 Sensations Pleasant sensation Elation
7:18 unpleasant sensation depression if that
7:20 continues courses after courses if that
7:23 continues in your morning and evening
7:26 sitting what benefit you expect no
7:28 benefit
7:31 otherwise even though something unwanted
7:34 has happened you reacted with the anger
7:37 and why this duration has become less
7:39 now you not started observing
7:40 respiration or
7:42 sensation because of your practice
7:44 morning and
7:46 evening without
7:49 intentionally trying to observe the
7:51 respiration or sensation a part to the
7:54 mind starts observing it you are boiling
7:57 in Anger one hour
7:59 you might get few moments here and there
8:02 when you observe your respiration You
8:04 observe your sensation next 1 hour again
8:07 few moments few moments those few
8:09 moments are wonderful moments like your
8:13 car is running with high speed going to
8:15 collide
8:16 somewhere and a break a momentary break
8:20 the speed becomes a little less again it
8:22 is running another break another break
8:25 it it went on it would have went on run
8:29 for say 8 hours now in 6 hours it stops
8:32 then 4 hours then 2 hours then 1 hour
8:34 your anger was so strong it would have
8:38 kept you boiling for 8 hours now because
8:40 of this momentary stoppage that you give
8:42 break that you give unintentionally it
8:44 happens because of your practice daily
8:46 practice and you're not playing the game
8:48 of sensation if you play the game of
8:50 sensation what happens now something has
8:52 happened which you don't like in the
8:54 outside world and because of that you
8:56 will get an unpleasant sensation and
8:58 because of that that you becoming angry
9:01 and when you feel the sensation all
9:03 these days this is what you have been
9:05 doing unpleasant
9:06 sensation you have negativity towards it
9:10 you don't have Equanimity in your mind
9:12 so now is unpleasant sensation you again
9:14 react to it you again react to it you're
9:16 not coming out of your misery but if you
9:19 work properly an unpleasant sensation
9:21 and you laugh and you smile oh this is
9:23 impermanent let me see how long it last
9:26 this is impermanent it arises to pass
9:28 away it arises to pass away and you find
9:30 this has started
9:32 working like this keep on examining
9:35 yourself whether you are making proper
9:37 use of v in your daily life or not don't
9:40 expect that in a 10day course one will
9:43 one will become so perfect that now they
9:45 will be no more negativity no more
9:46 boiling oh no it will become less less
9:51 less and that is good enough slow and
9:53 steadily you will find you are
9:54 progressing you progressing on the path
9:56 of dhama the path of Liberation
9:58 liberation from all the
10:03 miseries whenever a misery comes
10:06 everyone wants to come out of misery
10:08 nobody wants to roll in misery but it is
10:11 ignorance which makes us roll in misery
10:13 roll in misery for a long time Saints
10:16 sages of the past even ordinary human
10:19 beings they had been looking for a way
10:21 to come out of their misery something
10:24 has happened in life very
10:26 unpleasant and one has become very
10:28 miserable
10:30 and that incident keep on striking again
10:32 again in the Mind One becomes more and
10:34 more
10:35 miserable so one way out people thought
10:38 was just divert your
10:41 attention people started running after
10:43 sensual
10:45 Pleasures one is very miserable and to
10:47 come out of misery one will divert the
10:49 attention go to a cinema go to a theater
10:51 go to a dance hall go to a bar this or
10:54 that and feel yes I'm out of my misery
10:58 you're not out of misery
11:00 because all these sensual
11:02 Pleasures generates attachment in your
11:05 mind and attachment and misery go
11:07 together you are becoming more and more
11:10 miserable this is the two side of the
11:12 same coin when you got attachment to
11:16 sensual pleasure or to anything then
11:18 whenever you miss it you become so
11:20 agitated so miserable you're not coming
11:22 out of it no
11:24 solution then some saintly
11:27 persons they said divert your attention
11:29 not to the sensual places to something
11:31 else for example unwanted thing has
11:34 happened and you started generating
11:36 anger get up and walk a
11:39 little if that has not worked get up
11:42 drink a glass of water you're diverting
11:44 your
11:45 attention if that is not work just start
11:47 counting 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 you're
11:50 diverting your
11:51 attention if all that doesn't
11:54 work then a solution was given which
11:57 worked which still works
11:59 if you good devotion strong devotion in
12:03 any God or any goddess any saintly
12:06 person and liberated person enlightened
12:08 person in whomever you have got great
12:11 confidence or devotion just start
12:13 reciting his or her name mentally keep
12:17 on reciting reciting reciting because
12:19 you devotion it becomes easy for you to
12:21 recite it and as you are reciting you
12:23 are diverting your attention to
12:25 something else your anger subsides and
12:27 you feel that you free from anger
12:30 or another solution you just imagine the
12:33 shape or the form of that particular God
12:35 or particular goddess or saintly person
12:38 or enlightened person and keep on
12:40 remembering that imaginary shape or form
12:43 you'll find your mind is getting
12:44 diverted and you feel you are coming out
12:46 of your anger or your misery or any
12:49 negativity or any defilement that has
12:51 arisen in the mind you are coming out of
12:53 it it looks like that it looks like that
12:56 that you have pushed out your negativity
12:59 by reciting these names but the reality
13:02 is not so those who became fully
13:05 enlightened they became fully
13:07 enlightened because they explored the
13:09 entire field of mind and matter
13:11 transcended the entire field of mind and
13:14 matter and experience something beyond
13:16 that the Eternal truth ultimate truth
13:19 they experience the entire law of nature
13:22 they understood that whenever you divert
13:24 your
13:25 attention it appears as if you have put
13:29 aside your negativity but actually you
13:32 have suppressed your negativity it has
13:34 gone away from the surface level of the
13:36 mind and is being pushed deep inside at
13:39 the surface level of the mind you feel
13:40 look now there's no anger or no hatate
13:43 or no ill will or no paion or no fear
13:45 whatever negativity has come it's gone
13:47 now but suppressed deep inside at the
13:49 unconscious level or half conscious
13:51 level if it keeps on rolling there keeps
13:54 on multiplying multiplying multiplying
13:57 you not come out of your misery
14:00 Escape is no solution to the problem and
14:03 these unlighted people found out observe
14:06 it observe it whenever any negativity
14:10 arises if passion arises don't
14:13 suppress and don't give it a free
14:15 license to express itself at the vocal
14:18 level or the physical level similarly
14:21 fear arises anger arises hatate arises
14:24 worry arises don't suppress it and don't
14:27 give Express don't express it at the
14:29 vocal level find they gave a middle path
14:33 observe it anger is a reason observe it
14:36 passion as a reason observe it as You
14:40 observe you are not suppressing it as
14:43 you are just observing objectively
14:45 you're not expressing it just observing
14:47 and you find it becomes weaker weaker
14:49 weaker and passes away it has not become
14:52 a problem your problem is solved because
14:54 your is observing it very good
14:57 solution but very difficult to practice
15:00 very difficult to practice when a
15:02 negativity arises say anger as a reason
15:05 so quickly you get overpowered
15:08 overwhelmed you can't observe so
15:11 difficult something which you can't
15:14 observe is no solution then it's only
15:17 theoretically all right but you can't
15:19 practice it these unlighted people when
15:22 they gave any sermon or any advice it
15:24 was practical
15:26 advice they knew very well that when a
15:29 negativity arises it is so difficult for
15:32 anyone to observe the negativity
15:34 abstract negativity as it is but they
15:38 realized mind and matter are so
15:41 interrelated as soon as a negativity
15:43 arises in the mind say anger as a reason
15:45 passion as a reason fear as a reason any
15:47 impurity as a reason two things start
15:51 happening at the physical level one at a
15:53 little gross level other at a little
15:56 subtle level at the gross level you your
15:59 breath will lose its normality when you
16:01 have anger or passion or fear breath can
16:04 never remain normal it will become
16:06 little fast little hard when that
16:09 particular impurity has gone away again
16:11 it will become
16:12 normal so something starts happening at
16:14 the respiration level and another thing
16:17 at a subtler level some biochemical
16:20 reaction will start palpitation might
16:21 become inre heat may heat may be there
16:25 perspiration may be there tension may be
16:26 there something starts happening at the
16:28 the biochemical reaction of the body
16:30 level these two
16:33 things it is very difficult to observe
16:35 anger as anger abstract angle passion as
16:38 passion abstract
16:40 passion but if one practices it becomes
16:44 easy to observe the respiration to
16:46 observe the sensation on the body and
16:48 this is what they started teaching
16:51 because it was very clear that for
16:53 ordinary person once one gets developed
16:55 then it becomes easy even abstract anger
16:58 abstract patience
16:59 can be observed objectively otherwise
17:02 not even if you sit to meditate you
17:05 can't meditate anger is a
17:08 reason first important difficulty is
17:10 first important problem that comes is
17:12 you are so overpowered you don't
17:15 remember even that I should observe my
17:17 respiration or my sensation or the anger
17:20 you just get overwhelmed with that then
17:23 they must just somebody to remind you
17:25 you must have a private secretary around
17:28 whenever anger comes this private
17:29 secretary must mind you oh look Master
17:31 anger is coming and as Buddha said You
17:33 observe your anger observe your
17:35 anger private secretary will work for 8
17:38 hours only in the day and I don't have
17:40 agreement with the anger that you should
17:41 come only when my private secretary is
17:43 on duty it can come any time in 24 hours
17:46 any day in 365 days so I must have three
17:49 shift three private secretaries and
17:52 every country have their own labor laws
17:54 you must give staggering holidays so
17:55 four private secretaries or five private
17:57 secretaries who can
17:59 afford right somebody is afforded there
18:02 is always every moment a private
18:04 secretary like a shadow and anger is a
18:07 reason and this private secretary will
18:09 say oh look Master anger anger come out
18:12 of the anger observe anger the first
18:14 thing I do I slap him you fool are you
18:18 here to teach me I'm My Own master I
18:21 know I know what to
18:23 do anger anger is
18:27 anger all right I not behaved in the
18:30 wrong way and I thanked him all right
18:31 you were you were kept for that purpose
18:33 you have advised me very good now I must
18:35 observe my anger how to observe anger
18:38 there's no shape of anger there's no
18:41 color of anger you close your eyes and
18:43 try to observe anger what you will
18:45 observe only the object of anger so and
18:48 so said like this so and so did like
18:49 this something unwanted happened wanted
18:51 didn't happen and that keeps on coming
18:53 in your mind you're not observing anger
18:56 you're observing the object of the anger
18:58 and that is the stimulation for your
19:00 anger your anger becomes more and more
19:02 you're not observing anger and that is
19:05 why enlightened people said observe your
19:07 respiration observe sensation observing
19:11 respiration observing sensation you are
19:13 not diverting your attention to
19:15 something else because this very
19:17 sensation this very respiration is like
19:19 the other side of the coin on the one
19:22 side of the coin you got your mental
19:24 negativity on the other side these
19:26 physical things that are happening your
19:28 respiration becoming abnormal or your
19:30 sensation on the body so you are facing
19:32 the problem you're not running away from
19:34 the problem you're not suppressing the
19:36 problem a very wonderful solution was
19:38 found and for that one has to practice
19:41 no magic no Miracle the old habit
19:44 pattern of the Mind was always give
19:47 importance to things
19:48 outside things outside one never try to
19:52 understand what is happening
19:54 inside viasa helps you to see what is
19:58 happening inside which is more important
20:00 than things happening
20:02 outside when all importance is given to
20:04 things outside then one always remains
20:08 under the delusion that I am miserable
20:10 because of things outside I'm miserable
20:13 because so and so said like this or son
20:15 so did like this all the cause of my
20:18 misery I will keep on feeling is outside
20:20 outside
20:22 outside a husband will say if my wife
20:25 changes a little our house will become
20:28 like a Heaven everything will be all
20:30 right she has to change a little and ask
20:32 the wife she says the husband has to
20:34 change a little little change in the
20:36 husband oh
20:38 wonderful father will say the son should
20:40 change a little son will say the father
20:42 should change a little mother-in-law
20:44 will say the son-in-law should change
20:46 the daughter-in-law should change and
20:47 the daughter-in-law son-in-law will say
20:49 the Mother-in-law should change everyone
20:51 else should change not I I'm perfectly
20:52 all right what's wrong with me because
20:55 you find fault only outside outside you
20:58 always find the cause of your misery
21:00 outside outside so all your energy all
21:04 your strength throughout the life is
21:05 used to rectify things outside to
21:08 correct things outside nothing wrong but
21:11 big mistake that you are forgetting
21:13 everything about yourself what is
21:14 happening
21:16 inside your energy goes
21:19 waste first thing is that it is so
21:22 difficult to change others you no
21:24 control over others how can you change
21:26 others even if someone become comes the
21:29 sole ruler of the old world so much
21:32 power yet it is not possible that in
21:35 this person's life everything will
21:37 happen according to his or her wishes
21:39 nothing will go against his or her
21:40 wishes not possible even with all the
21:43 power one tries to correct somebody
21:46 amend somebody where is the guarantee
21:49 that somebody else will not raise the
21:50 head and start doing something against
21:52 your wishes impossible you can't change
21:55 the whole world but you can certainly
21:57 change yourself certainly change
21:59 yourself they're just saying in our
22:02 country the path is full of thorn full
22:05 of thorn full of
22:07 Pebbles you try to clean it very
22:10 difficult and you walk the thorn will
22:13 trouble you the Pebbles will trouble you
22:15 the best thing wear shoes and walk over
22:17 it you're protected you don't worry
22:20 about this thornel they will remain let
22:21 them be
22:22 there there is Sun very strong sun and
22:26 you want the Sun not to be so strong
22:28 it's too hot for me you can't do
22:31 anything take your umbrella take the
22:33 shade and run doesn't matter so you
22:35 protect yourself and protecting yourself
22:38 is just observe what wrong inside this
22:41 is what you started doing by
22:46 practicing unless you understand the
22:48 truth the totality of the truth you
22:51 always remain
22:54 deluded
22:56 PA the literal meaning of the word
23:02 you understand things from different
23:04 angles if you try to understand the
23:07 problem only from from one angle it a
23:10 partial truth and partial truth is
23:12 always distorted truth it does not help
23:16 you when you see the same problem from
23:18 different angles you are coming nearer
23:20 and nearer to the totality of the truth
23:23 then the delution goes away then your
23:25 decisions are good your actions are good
23:27 because you are with the totality of the
23:29 truth one story of the
23:33 past five blind birth blind people were
23:36 brought near an elephant they never seen
23:39 an elephant blind from birth and they
23:42 were asked to examine elephant and say
23:43 what what elephant is someone caught
23:46 hold of the foot of the elephant the leg
23:48 of the
23:49 elephant ah I know it's like a post for
23:52 him it's like a post someone got hold of
23:54 the tail of the elephant it's like a
23:57 brush a br broom for him elephant is a
24:00 brush a broom like that all five of them
24:03 gave their definition of elephant which
24:05 is true but partial true far away from
24:08 the actual truth like this if we keep
24:10 and keep on seeing things only from one
24:14 angle then it's only a partial truth a
24:16 distorted truth all our decisions will
24:18 go
24:19 wrong starts helping you the PA starts
24:22 helping you to see things from different
24:25 angle one very important angle which was
24:29 missing from the time when has taken
24:31 birth opened eyes only seeing outside
24:33 outside outside when never care to see
24:36 what is happening inside now the person
24:38 has given you another angle something
24:40 has happened outside let me see what's
24:42 happening inside so you are not with the
24:45 distorted truth only one angle at least
24:47 you got two angles now outside inside
24:49 and as you progress you will have more
24:51 angles to see things but this angle
24:54 seeing things inside is such an
24:56 important Angle now you find the cause
25:00 of your misery 100% cause of your misery
25:02 outside but as you progress on the path
25:05 and you start observing things inside
25:08 very soon you will reach the stage where
25:10 you will start saying yes something
25:13 happened outside but also something
25:15 happened inside so cause of my misery is
25:17 50% outside 50% inside all right you
25:21 started sharing the responsibility 50%
25:24 you do something to change yourself 50%
25:26 doesn't matter the time is bound to come
25:29 if you really practice viai time is
25:31 bound to come when you will start
25:34 realizing 100% cause lies inside not
25:37 even quarter per is outside 100% cause
25:41 of my misery is inside nothing outside
25:43 can make me miserable as nothing outside
25:46 can make me happy 100% cause of my real
25:49 happiness lies inside 100% cause of my
25:52 Miser lies inside then you start working
25:54 inside you give all importance to inside
25:57 and the whole life pattern will change
25:59 you'll come out of your misery so easily
26:01 because you started seeing things
26:04 inside somebody has done something which
26:08 has harmed you somebody has done great
26:10 Injustice to you an
26:13 example you take your case to the court
26:17 I don't know how it is in this part of
26:19 the world back in our country when
26:21 something goes to the court litigation
26:23 it takes years together from this court
26:25 to that court to appet court etc etc and
26:27 then riches the federal court the
26:29 Supreme Court it takes 7
26:32 years 7 years the case went to the
26:34 Supreme Court and the Chief Justice of
26:36 Supreme Court went through all the
26:37 papers and all the evidences and gave
26:40 decision that the other person person is
26:44 100% at fault you got no fault and he
26:47 should be punished all right he has
26:49 given a punishment according to the law
26:50 of the country but if I a wise person I
26:54 start thinking if there was no fault no
26:57 fault on my part
26:59 Supreme Court just say I got no fault
27:01 then why I suffered for this s years s
27:04 Years day and night I no peace of mind
27:07 there must be some law of nature some
27:09 law of God Almighty why I was penalized
27:12 with you start understanding why you
27:15 were penalized you are responsible every
27:18 moment you are boiling with negativity
27:20 so and so did like this so and so did
27:21 you responsible you kept on Boiling
27:25 yourself somebody comes and abuses you
27:29 just an incident somebody has come and
27:30 abused you he is your enemy he doesn't
27:33 want to see you happy he wants to see
27:35 you unhappy that's why he has abused he
27:37 has insulted he has abused you once made
27:39 you unhappy and gone away and now what
27:42 happens he just wanted you to be unhappy
27:45 only once because he abused only once
27:47 and now what happens you say all right
27:48 shake hands you want me to be unhappy I
27:50 will remain unhappy for hours together
27:53 for days together for years together
27:56 sometimes you say that he insulted me so
27:58 much I don't forget for the whole life
28:00 don't forget for the Whole Life whom are
28:02 you obliging you'll keep on rolling in
28:04 misery hell misery for whole life I
28:06 don't forget for seven lives seven Life
28:08 In
28:09 Hell Madness what we are doing in the
28:13 first instance it was a mistake on our
28:15 part somebody brought a present of abuse
28:17 and we accepted it when somebody is
28:20 abusing it is the problem of this person
28:23 his person his problem her problem full
28:25 of negativity this is his misery why
28:27 share the that misery why take that
28:29 misery on you just smile like Buddha all
28:32 right it is I have not accepted your you
28:34 present you to suffer for that you to
28:36 suffer for that I can't suffer for you I
28:39 won't suffer that itself was AIG big
28:41 mistake and then you kept on rolling you
28:44 kept on remembering he insulted me like
28:46 this she insulted me like this you keep
28:48 on staging the drama on the platform of
28:51 your mind again again again years
28:53 together no one else is responsible for
28:56 that you yourself responsible for that
28:59 as you examine more and more the reality
29:01 inside things will become so clear so
29:03 clear I am responsible whenever I react
29:07 I bring misery to me I don't react
29:09 whatever happens outside I'm not
29:10 miserable I can smile so the entire
29:13 responsibility lies with me deep inside
29:16 I change my own habit pattern I become
29:19 Free From Misery I start living a better
29:21 life but that requires lot of Practice
29:24 Things become easier if you practice
29:27 with
29:28 properly this material structure how it
29:31 is working how biochemical reactions are
29:34 coming because of the different
29:35 Sensations are coming how the mind the
29:37 four parts of the Mind the vyana the
29:40 cognizing part of the mind is working
29:42 the SAA the recognizing part is working
29:46 the V the feeling part is working and
29:48 the Shankar the reacting part is working
29:50 how they are working if you keep on
29:52 observing them you will notice that the
29:55 fourth part the Sankara part the
29:57 reacting part
29:58 has become so strong for you and the
30:01 first part the vyana just cognizing
30:03 remaining OB observing things
30:05 objectively has become so weak so weak
30:08 and the fourth has become so strong oh
30:11 this is the reason of your misery and by
30:13 the practice of vashna you will find the
30:15 fourth part the V the shankara becomes
30:18 weaker weaker weaker even if you react
30:21 it is like a line drawn on the water it
30:23 won't be so deep and the first part
30:25 observing observing observing object L
30:28 become stronger stronger stronger you
30:30 are coming out of your misery easily
30:33 otherwise if the practice of vashna is
30:35 not done properly the results you can't
30:38 expect the results that you should get
30:40 by practice of Vash as you keep on
30:43 observing the reality it becomes so
30:45 clear where the mistake is where the
30:48 misery starts how the misery starts
30:51 otherwise one keeps on
30:53 saying whenever I see this
30:56 person I start generating
30:58 negativity is it so that means something
31:01 wrong in this person the biochemistry of
31:04 this person is such that your
31:06 biochemistry starts changing and
31:07 generate negativity if that is so then
31:11 everyone who sees this person must
31:13 generate negativity it doesn't happen
31:16 the same person seen by five at the same
31:19 time one generates negativity anger
31:21 other May generate passion the third May
31:23 generate fear the fourth May generate
31:25 something else all five generating
31:27 different things
31:28 oh then it becomes clear it is not there
31:32 something wrong in me each individual
31:34 has one's own
31:36 problem an
31:38 example a artist a very good artist on a
31:43 canvas with his or her brush and the ink
31:47 draws a picture a very beautiful image
31:50 comes out very beautiful starts looking
31:53 at that image ah wonderful this person
31:56 is so wonderful and then is the balance
31:58 of the mind I want to live with this
32:00 person I must live with this person so
32:02 beautiful person and people say you are
32:04 a mad fellow you own creation your own
32:07 imagination there is no truth in it and
32:09 you want to live with this picture how
32:10 is that possible oh no I can't live
32:12 without this person I must get this
32:14 person M fellow similarly the same
32:18 artist May draw another picture very
32:20 horrible very ferocious oh this person
32:23 is so bad so ferocious he will eat me he
32:25 will devour me please save me please say
32:27 people say mad fellow your own creation
32:29 your own imagination what you
32:31 doing we can say this Artist as a mad
32:35 fellow but each one is playing the same
32:38 game each one keeps on drawing pictures
32:41 and then keep on reacting to those
32:42 pictures each one keeps on carving
32:45 images and then keeps on reacting to
32:46 those images all imaginary pictures
32:49 imaginary carvings and yet what a great
32:52 reaction is
32:53 there an example 20 years back 20 years
32:58 back somebody said something or did
33:00 something that I did not like that means
33:03 my did not like my sa said very bad and
33:07 as soon as the said very bad shankara
33:09 reacted very bad person negativity arose
33:13 and I carved image of this person very
33:17 bad fellow very bad fellow for 20 years
33:20 I not seen him after 20 years with the
33:23 interval of 20 years I see the same
33:25 person and I start reacting very bad
33:27 fellow very bad fellow oh in 20 years he
33:30 might have become a saintly person who
33:32 knows and even the first instance it was
33:35 only my son which said very bad fellow
33:37 actually he might not have been bad who
33:38 knows my own creation I have carved
33:42 image of this person very bad fellow
33:44 very bad fellow I'm reacting to this
33:46 image created by me carved by me this
33:49 comes between the reality of this person
33:51 and my reaction this comes in between
33:53 and I reacting to this similarly another
33:56 example 20 years back somebody said
33:59 something or did something which I liked
34:01 that means my son like ah wonderful and
34:05 evaluation was given ah wonderful person
34:08 a thorough gentleman thorough gentleman
34:11 what a saintly person saintly person 20
34:14 years I not seen him with interval of 20
34:17 years I see that image comes ah Thor
34:21 gentlem he might have become a
34:23 devil during these 20 20 years he might
34:27 have change so much and who knows in the
34:29 first instant he might have been a devil
34:31 only my said a very thorough gentleman
34:34 very good gentleman I'm reacting to my
34:36 own
34:37 images that reality will become clearer
34:40 and clearer if you start examining how
34:43 your four parts of the Mind are working
34:46 how the interaction of the body the
34:47 material structure interaction is going
34:50 on and all that will become so clear if
34:52 you just observe objectively objectively
34:54 objectively
34:57 same person same object seen by five
35:00 different persons five different persons
35:02 are good five different images of the
35:04 same person they are reacting to their
35:05 own images not to this
35:07 person even the same object it comes to
35:11 me comes to in contact with my sense
35:14 door eyes or ears or
35:16 anywhere five different times the same
35:19 object and yet I react in five different
35:21 ways the same object say certain words
35:24 come to my ear five times same words
35:27 have come and I have reacted in five
35:29 different ways if I a good be personal
35:31 meditator it will become so clear an
35:33 example example is example no reality in
35:36 it just
35:38 example one evening I am
35:41 walking I'm walking with the five of my
35:45 students it's evening little dark on the
35:49 foot path somebody's lying there and one
35:52 of my
35:53 student hits this person kicks this
35:56 person and this person shouts
35:58 are you blind you got eyes or button
36:02 holes these words come to my
36:05 ear and I find a wonderful sensation in
36:08 my body very pleasant sensation a flow
36:11 of very pleasant sensation somebody's
36:13 abused you got eyes or button holes and
36:15 I'm getting a very pleasant
36:17 sensation one
36:19 incident second incident I'm going alone
36:23 I have hit this person and he shouts the
36:26 same language the same words the same
36:27 tone are you blind you got eyes are
36:30 button holes now I find no Pleasant
36:32 sensation no Pleasant sensation
36:34 unpleasant Sensations are there third
36:37 incident again example is example I'm
36:40 going and with me my five students and
36:43 again I have hit I have hit and again
36:46 you shouted same words are you blind you
36:49 got eyes or button holes and I find the
36:52 unpleasant sensation is more severe than
36:54 last time same words but yet such
36:58 difference fourth time just an example
37:01 again I am walking I have hit the person
37:04 again the same tone he shouted are you
37:06 blind you got eyes or button holes and
37:08 suddenly I realize these are the words
37:09 of my son my son my son abusing me are
37:13 you blind you got eyes or button holes
37:16 oh the sensation becomes so unpleasant
37:19 so
37:20 unpleasant fifth time again example is
37:23 example I'm walking with five of my
37:25 students I have hit this person he Shout
37:27 Ed in the same way I have recognized my
37:29 son oh now it is totally unbearable
37:33 unbearable why the same words came to
37:37 the ears five times and why it is so
37:39 different what happens a good person
37:42 meditator will start understanding what
37:43 happens the first time first time when
37:46 these words came my say yes these are
37:50 words of abuse but not for you not for
37:52 you they are for your students and these
37:56 students I keep on teaching them be
37:59 aware be aware walk with aware walk with
38:03 mindfulness they are so matur they not
38:07 understood anything hit somebody and
38:09 they to suffer this
38:11 abuse I am a v teacher I can't make such
38:14 mistake look this abuse is not for me it
38:18 is for my student and there is a
38:20 pleasant sensation
38:25 through as soon as takes birth and
38:30 grows and uh comes to senses whether one
38:34 comes to senses or loses senses who
38:36 knows but in the worldly language we say
38:38 one comes to senses the first thing one
38:40 one does carves a image image of oneself
38:45 IA and when I car my own image I car
38:47 very beautiful beautifula wonderful
38:51 wonderful and I establish this image in
38:54 the temple of my mind wonderful goka is
38:56 so wonderful
38:58 now first time when I found that abuse
39:01 is to my students who are immature I'm a
39:03 matured person I'm a personal teacher
39:05 then this image got some more shiny over
39:07 it some more polish ah wonderful go is
39:10 so wonderful he cannot make mistakes
39:12 others make
39:13 mistakes second time the same abuse and
39:17 my say it is for you now not for your
39:19 student there's no student here and this
39:22 image that was carved and attachment
39:24 towards this image and this image get
39:26 shattered somebody somebody abusing me
39:30 such a big personal teacher me what
39:32 happened to you you're not bleeding
39:34 you're not dying away what's wrong why
39:36 you shout the whole attitude changes now
39:40 very unpleasant sensation
39:42 starts and third time again why it was
39:45 much
39:45 more because these five students who
39:48 were with
39:49 me one keeps on making this madness one
39:52 carves one's image and establishes in
39:55 one's own mind develops lot of
39:57 attachment that itself is madness now
40:00 another thing that one Keeps On Doing
40:02 gets establishes a good image of oneself
40:04 in the minds of others every student
40:06 must know goka is wonderful oh look goka
40:10 is wonderful and that image one plays so
40:13 many dramas and so many things just to
40:15 establish a good image these five
40:17 students I had done so much to establish
40:20 my good image in the minds of these five
40:21 students now all these five students the
40:24 image is shattered previously only one
40:26 image was shattered now five images
40:28 getting shuttered I feel so unhappy five
40:31 times more
40:33 unhappy somebody abuses me when I am
40:36 alone I say it doesn't matter he has
40:38 abused me but in public with so many
40:41 people what makes the difference abuse
40:43 is abuse whether you are alone or
40:45 whether you are with so many other
40:46 people because you put your image in the
40:49 minds of so many people and now that get
40:51 shattered you are much more unhappy that
40:54 becomes clearer and clearer as you go
40:56 deeper and make anal IAL study of the
40:58 things fourth time why it is more
41:02 unhappy I I the sphere of ey increases
41:06 now mine mine mine and you start making
41:10 images of mine my son my daughter my
41:14 wife my husband my mother my father my
41:17 so my so my so and you car a beautiful
41:21 image and you start developing
41:23 tremendous amount of
41:24 attachment at the apparent level you
41:27 keep on fooling yourself I love my son I
41:31 love my wife I love my husband I love my
41:33 mother I love my father if you go deeper
41:35 you will understand you don't love
41:37 anybody at the time of Buddha the king
41:41 of the
41:42 country he came in contact with Buddha
41:45 meditated became a good V meditator and
41:48 one member of the family becomes good
41:50 meditator other slowly get attracted so
41:52 the whole family was a
41:54 v his wife Malika the queen she also
41:58 very good meditator both of them
42:00 meditate in their meditation room in the
42:03 palace one day after 1 hour sitting this
42:06 King asked the queen
42:08 Malika tell me whom do you love the most
42:12 in the world and she says wonderful the
42:15 same question came in my mind while I
42:16 was meditating and I realized I love
42:19 myself I don't love anybody I don't
42:22 don't love
42:24 anybody just smiled he said the same
42:26 question came to my mind I examined
42:28 myself I found I love only myself I
42:30 don't love anybody without weite would
42:33 have been totally different a queen
42:35 saying to the king that I don't I love
42:37 only myself not you her head would have
42:39 been taken off what kind of queen but
42:41 now both har pitat very happy they went
42:44 to Buddha and said sir in meditation it
42:47 so happened Buddha said sadhu sadhu
42:49 sadhu this is the beginning where you
42:51 can start Rectify yourself so long as
42:54 one remains under the delution that I
42:56 love so and so I love so and so I love
42:58 so and so one does not come out of the
43:00 madness when one starts realizing I love
43:03 myself oh look what a self-centered
43:05 person I am what a selfish person I am
43:09 whom you say mine my son my wife my
43:11 husband etc etc you got to dream you
43:15 have certain aspirations and you want
43:17 this person to fulfill those dreams you
43:20 are dreaming that this person will
43:21 fulfill my dream such and such dream and
43:24 that's why you are loving your love is
43:26 expecting something in turn and when
43:29 your love is expecting something in turn
43:31 you're not loving this person you loving
43:33 yourself you loving your own aspirations
43:35 you're loving your own dreams
43:37 self-centered love it doesn't help Pure
43:40 Love is just one way traffic you give
43:42 you don't expect anything in you just
43:44 give just give when a PNA meditator
43:47 starts realizing that then one starts
43:50 coming out of this selfishness this
43:52 narrow-mindedness so now what happened
43:54 in the fourth time this son of mine so
43:57 much dream was taken when he grows he
43:59 will be son of a bip teacher so he will
44:02 be serving him like anything he'll be so
44:04 obedient like this and like that and now
44:08 my says these words are from your son my
44:10 son abusing me ordinary person on the
44:13 street whom I didn't know and with whom
44:15 I had no dreams for future this person
44:17 abuses me I don't like it but it doesn't
44:20 have much effect my son he abuses me oh
44:24 it becomes so
44:25 unbearable now fifth time where it is
44:28 much more unbearable because the same
44:31 mistake I keep on doing the image of my
44:32 son as I try to establish my image in
44:35 the minds of others I try to establish
44:37 the image of my son my daughter my wife
44:40 my soul my so so wonderful they may have
44:42 some defect but I keep on covering the
44:44 defect oh no no no they are so wonderful
44:46 so wonderful now the images I establish
44:49 in the mind of five my students about my
44:51 son those images got shattered I am five
44:55 times more unhappy all that will become
44:57 very clear when you when you know how to
44:59 observe your sensation something has
45:01 happened what kind of sensation
45:03 something has happened what kind of
45:04 sensation this is how vashna will help
45:08 you unless you make use of vashna in
45:11 your daily life then it will become like
45:13 any other organized religion one goes to
45:16 a temple one goes to a church one goes
45:18 to a pagoda one goes to a mosque
45:20 performs this right that right feels
45:22 very happy I'm a very religious person
45:24 I'm a very religious person it doesn't
45:26 help in the life deluding oneself if
45:30 also made that way I take one course
45:32 every year I sit morning and evening and
45:34 my duty is over now let Buddha do
45:36 something for me he will do because I'm
45:38 doing his job he told me to do this I'm
45:40 doing it now it is his job to save me
45:42 from all misery doesn't work it is
45:45 changing your own habit
45:46 pattern understanding at the depth how
45:49 you are making yourself
45:51 miserable moment to moment you're
45:53 creating only misery for you either
45:55 craving either abortion either craving
45:57 or abortion this Sensation that
45:59 sensation craving abortion craving
46:01 abortion a bundle of misery and by this
46:03 technique you are coming out of this mad
46:05 habit coming out of your misery a
46:07 purpose to come to a course like
46:10 this should not be taken like a right or
46:13 a ritual there must be a purpose for
46:15 your coming and the main purpose is that
46:19 you understand the reality of mind and
46:21 matter within yourself at the
46:23 experiential level and every time you
46:26 come
46:27 you are developing certain qualities in
46:29 you and those qualities will help you to
46:32 reach the final goal of full Liberation
46:35 in the language of the past in Buddha's
46:38 language there are 10 such good
46:40 qualities and when you fulfill those
46:42 qualities you reach the final goal
46:44 easily they are called Pari Pari is a
46:48 quality which helps you to the Cross to
46:51 cross the ocean of misery and this the
46:53 other Shore free from all misery there
46:56 are 10 part paries and one gets
46:58 wonderful opportunity coming to a course
47:00 like this to develop all the 10 paries
47:03 little by little little by little like
47:05 your 10 jars 10 pots and even if you put
47:08 one drop one drop in each drop by drop
47:11 drop by drop a time will come when all
47:13 these jars will get fil fulfilled and
47:15 you reach the final goal what are these
47:17 10 paries what are these 10 qualities
47:19 remember them so that next time you come
47:22 you be very careful that you have put at
47:24 least one drop in each jar more the
47:26 better
47:28 one par
47:29 me Nik par a Pary of
47:34 renunciation want us to renounce the
47:36 householders life so that there's no
47:39 attachment
47:41 left everyone is not prepared to
47:43 renounce the householders life everyone
47:46 cannot become a monk or a nun then how
47:48 to develop this Pary and it's a
47:50 important par me then this wonderful
47:53 opportunity for 10 days although one has
47:56 not not shaven the head and one has not
47:58 changeed the robes but for all practical
48:01 purposes one lives a life of a monk one
48:04 lives a life of a
48:05 nun because in courses like
48:08 this you live on the charity of
48:11 others whatever food you take is Charity
48:14 of others whatever facility you have is
48:17 Charity of others and what for one
48:20 becomes there's nothing to say mine mine
48:23 mine the all these pares are to take you
48:27 to the stage where entire ego gets
48:30 dissolved the final stage of egolessness
48:33 takes you to the final goal and with
48:36 renunciation one becomes a monk and with
48:38 the begging ball in the hand ask food
48:41 from house to house the ego starts
48:43 getting dissolved dissolved you get a
48:46 wonderful opportunity
48:49 here initially when courses were
48:52 started in India and for some time here
48:56 also then we didn't have our centers
48:59 then one mistake was there we couldn't
49:01 Rectify and it took time to
49:03 rectify charges were taken from the
49:07 students no charges for the teaching
49:10 because teaching is so invaluable What
49:12 charges can give What charges can
49:13 anybody give but at least for boarding
49:16 Ling the actual expenses out of pocket
49:18 expenses we charged from the students it
49:21 was wrong but once the center started
49:24 coming up around the world then then the
49:27 dhama started being taught in its pure
49:29 way pure form if money is charged then
49:33 you don't get this Pary of
49:35 renunciation because all the time you
49:37 feel I'm paying for it and when you take
49:39 your meals oh this is not to my taste I
49:42 paid for it no this not good I want that
49:44 I want that your ego is there otherwise
49:47 like a monk like a nun whatever comes in
49:49 the begging ball Beggars of no choice
49:51 you get it you ate it you're happy with
49:53 that you are dissolving your ego very
49:56 important
49:57 for that purpose no charges should be
49:59 taken no charges of teaching no charges
50:02 of boarding no charges of of
50:05 lodging when we first gave this idea to
50:07 the people in India all the trust is
50:10 were when the when the center was
50:12 established they were so afraid what K
50:14 Kaji what you are doing this is such a
50:16 poor country people don't get meals for
50:19 days together and you are giving free
50:20 meals here there will be such a big
50:23 crowd I said don't worry let them come
50:26 they to work from morning 4: 4:30 till
50:29 night 9
50:30 9:30 if they work doesn't matter if they
50:33 come only for me then they won't work
50:35 then they have to run away so it doesn't
50:37 matter and doesn't matter nothing
50:38 happened it went perfectly all right
50:40 people came to work seriously same thing
50:42 here also when I started in the west
50:45 people said well in the west people will
50:48 suspect you why you not charging even
50:51 for food there's something wrong some
50:55 intention wrong intention is there or
50:57 you are supported by some government or
51:00 some intelligence group or something
51:03 something is happening otherwise how
51:05 somebody can give free boarding free
51:06 lodging how that is possible not
51:08 possible so this doubt won't allow
51:11 people I say this doubt will go don't
51:12 worry and look it is going away so dama
51:15 when it is taught in this pure form is
51:17 so helpful to the students and it helps
51:20 them to develop this Pary renunciation
51:23 Pary one feels I'm a monk here for 10
51:26 days is I am a monk I am a nun I to live
51:29 like a monk like a nun on the charity of
51:31 others and this helps them another par
51:35 me she
51:37 AP the five precepts that you take here
51:40 you are supposed to observe them outside
51:43 also but it is so difficult in outside
51:45 world you keep on breaking this or
51:47 breaking that although it may be due to
51:49 the environment because you are kept
51:52 busy from morning 4 4:30 till night 9
51:54 9:30 there's no opportunity for you to
51:56 break
51:57 so at least for for 9 days or 10 days
52:00 you keep your Sheila so perfect when you
52:03 start talking 10th day tomorrow slight
52:06 danger is
52:07 [Music]
52:09 there that's why silence for 9 days to
52:12 observe this Sheil when you start
52:14 talking you may exate something or you
52:16 hide something and your shea is broken
52:18 so at least for 9 days perfect Sheila
52:21 you get this wonderful Pary and the next
52:24 Pary is viia ofer
52:27 as a householder one has to make effort
52:29 but every effort one does makes is to
52:31 earn money for livelihood yes one has to
52:34 work but coming to a course like this
52:37 the Via is the real via a via to purify
52:40 your mind a via to live a good life all
52:43 the efforts that you make are the
52:45 efforts to purify your mind to purify
52:48 your mind this goes to your credit the
52:50 credit of Pary viia
52:53 Pari and the next PA Pari
52:57 wisdom staying at home also reading
53:00 scriptures going and listening to some
53:03 dhma discourses somewhere you get
53:08 wisdom but that is not is B you have to
53:12 live the life of wisdom living wisdom
53:15 and all that happens while you are here
53:17 for 10 days living wisdom you're
53:19 experiencing wisdom you're experiencing
53:21 the truth of the things inside and you
53:23 are experiencing the law of nature
53:25 inside and you EXP experiencing how to
53:27 live in line with the law of the nature
53:29 this becomes your Pary the PA
53:32 Pari another Pari kti me tolerance
53:36 tolerance coming to a course like this
53:39 100 students or 200 students sitting
53:42 together
53:43 meditating you try not to disturb others
53:47 but somebody starts disturbing you
53:48 somebody starts coughing somebody starts
53:52 burping somebody starts
53:54 hiccuping something happens and you feel
53:56 so irritated mad fellows why they
53:59 disturbing others and then suddenly you
54:01 realize oh I have come here not to
54:03 generate negativity I must generate only
54:06 compassion love this person is ignorant
54:09 or this person is a sick person I
54:11 generate negativity and you come out of
54:13 this negativity you learn how to develop
54:15 your Pary of of Tolerance k k and the
54:20 next par Pary of Truth Truth at the
54:24 vocal level is a good par me but here at
54:27 a deeper subtler level every step on the
54:30 path must be with the truth truth truth
54:33 that you experience not the truth
54:35 experienced by goad Buddha or the truth
54:37 experienced by Jesus Christ or the truth
54:39 experienced by your teacher nothing
54:41 doing your own experience from moment to
54:43 moment moment to moment this will take
54:45 you to the final goal of ultimate truth
54:47 so truth truth truth this part may
54:50 become stronger stronger
54:54 stronger strong determination
54:57 somebody comes to a course like this the
54:59 first thing one does strong
55:01 determination I will stay here for 10
55:03 days let anything happen I won't run
55:06 away on the second day I won't run away
55:08 on the six day I won't run away on any
55:09 day I will be here for 10 days any kind
55:12 of operation is acceptable to me another
55:15 one takes I will observe all the rules
55:17 regulations discipline
55:20 timetable and this Adan
55:22 helps another Adan which comes after V
55:26 you sit for one hour three times you
55:28 don't change your legs you don't open
55:30 your hands you don't open your eyes so
55:32 much of pain and yet you fulfill it that
55:35 par is a wonderful par and it is so
55:37 helpful in the long
55:39 run understand when this person became
55:41 fully
55:42 enlightened that night when he sat under
55:44 the tree he sat with the Adit with a
55:47 strong determination that I won't change
55:49 my
55:50 posture not till 1 hour or 2 hour till I
55:53 become fully enlightened it may take you
55:56 together that all my bones get scattered
55:58 I don't mind I won't change my
56:01 posture and if you come to that stage
56:05 and you sit and 10 minutes a pain starts
56:07 you said no no no no I will sit later on
56:11 I will sit later on so for lives
56:14 together you to develop this
56:17 this so that when your time comes you
56:20 sit with the strong determination and
56:22 come out successful very important very
56:24 important
56:26 another par
56:28 me met tomorrow you will learn this
56:32 technique love for all beings love for
56:35 all being compassion for all
56:38 beings well we are taught from the
56:40 childhood Love Thy Neighbor Love Thy
56:42 Neighbor so we keep on saying at the
56:43 surface level may you be happy oh my
56:46 neighbor may you be happy may you be
56:47 happy but we have got so much negativity
56:49 towards this person deep inside we keep
56:51 on saying you go to hell oh my neighbor
56:53 you go to hell you're so bad
56:56 that doesn't work that doesn't become a
56:57 Pary Because deep inside your
57:00 unconscious mind is much stronger than
57:02 the surface level mind so when you keep
57:04 on giving MAA only at the surface level
57:06 it doesn't work it doesn't become your
57:08 par this technique for 9 days you keep
57:11 on keep on purifying your mind keep on
57:13 purifying your mind keep on breaking the
57:15 barrier the barrier between the Surface
57:17 mind and the inside mind and then
57:20 tomorrow on the 10th day you learn this
57:22 MAA may all beings be happy may all
57:25 beings share my peace is my Harmony then
57:27 there is no trace of negativity and you
57:29 are learning the real ma which which
57:31 goes to your credit as a Pary and the
57:33 next UPA with all the experiences that
57:37 you have here UPA Equanimity Equanimity
57:40 Equanimity whatever experience you have
57:42 pleasant unpleasant neutral Equanimity
57:46 you got a wonderful opportunity
57:48 otherwise in the life when ups and downs
57:50 are coming visites are coming you may
57:52 have Equanimity but that Equanimity will
57:54 be at the surface level of the Mind
57:56 but now you are experiencing at the
57:58 depth of the Mind the sensations are
58:00 experienced by the deepest level of the
58:02 mind and you're training this deepest
58:04 level of the Mind remain
58:07 equanimous this becomes your par and the
58:11 next
58:13 Dani
58:15 donation as a
58:18 householder it is very difficult for a
58:20 householder to reach the final goal why
58:23 main difficulty is that householder is
58:26 not supposed to go and beg food a monk
58:29 and none should go out and beg food a
58:32 householder has to work hard very hard
58:34 work honestly and earn money support
58:37 oneself support those who are depending
58:39 and support others this is the
58:41 responsibility of a
58:42 household once you start working and you
58:45 start earning then the ego gets inflated
58:49 look I'm such a smart person I am such a
58:52 clever person I am so intelligent and
58:54 that is why I'm successful are not
58:56 successful I earn this much I earn that
58:58 much money that comes develops so much
59:01 of ego in the mind and so long as the
59:03 ego is there you are far away from the
59:05 final goal of full Liberation now how to
59:08 come out of this ego on the one hand one
59:10 has to earn money and on the other hand
59:12 every money that comes generates ego in
59:14 you that is why the saintly people the
59:16 enlightened people they advised that
59:18 whenever you earn you keep on
59:21 understanding that you're are not
59:22 earning for yourself of course you are
59:25 earning for your own maintenance and the
59:27 maintenance of all those who depend on
59:28 you but you're also earning for others
59:31 for
59:33 others others have got share in my
59:35 earning then the ego becomes less less
59:38 less less it won't be that
59:41 strong in a course like
59:44 this 10 days are over one has been
59:48 dissolving the ego dissolving the ego
59:50 purifying the Mind purifying the mind
59:52 then whatever donation one gives
59:54 according to one's own capacity less or
59:55 more MO is a material gives with a
59:58 purity of mind not expecting anything in
1:00:01 return Even This Dana becomes very
1:00:03 impure when you expect something in
1:00:05 return Your Love becomes very impure
1:00:08 when you expect something in return your
1:00:10 service to others becomes very impure if
1:00:12 you expect something in return so also
1:00:14 the Dana becomes very impure if you
1:00:16 expect something in return I have given
1:00:19 so much Dana so there must be one
1:00:21 Bungalow made for me whenever I come I
1:00:24 must be there all all Comforts for me
1:00:26 when I'm not there all right let others
1:00:28 others use it doesn't matter but when I
1:00:30 come and first admission I must always
1:00:33 get admission all those expecting
1:00:35 something in return or I have given so
1:00:38 much Dana so on this Bangalore on this
1:00:40 structure my name should be written
1:00:42 donated by goka the great goka all that
1:00:45 Madness because one doesn't know what
1:00:47 dma is this is what one has been doing
1:00:50 the whole life working here for 9 days
1:00:52 for 10 days dissolving ego dissolving
1:00:54 ego oh whatever I am giving is for the
1:00:57 good of others as I got so much benefit
1:01:00 because somebody gave for me somebody
1:01:03 gave this charity and that is why I got
1:01:05 all this wonderful dhama which is so
1:01:06 good for me May similarly more and more
1:01:09 people get benefit from it so the
1:01:11 charity that comes from the mind of
1:01:13 Purity just helping others seeing others
1:01:16 coming out of the misery this goes to
1:01:18 your credit as a Pary otherwise if the
1:01:21 ego gets built up then it is no more
1:01:22 Pary all these 10 paries you get one
1:01:25 wonderful opportunity coming to a course
1:01:27 like this coming to a course like this

1:01:56 or small ports if you're going to become
1:01:57 a fully enlightened person the jar is
1:01:59 too big it takes time doesn't matter but
1:02:02 otherwise full Liberation comes even
1:02:04 with smaller jar but all these 10 jars
1:02:06 must be filled all the 10 paries must be
1:02:09 complete and that completion you get a
1:02:12 wonderful opportunity coming to a course
