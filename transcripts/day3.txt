0:00 The third day is over.
0:13 You have seven more left to work.
0:19 Tomorrow, the fourth day is a very important day for you.
0:30 You will start practicing Vipassana.
0:36 That means you will start entering the field of Panya, wisdom, insight.
0:49 Whatever you practiced for these three days was a very important prerequisite for your work tomorrow.
1:03 The actual work starts tomorrow.
1:08 These three days you were preparing yourself to start the actual work of Vipassana meditation.
1:22 Without strong Sheela, it is not possible to practice Vipassana, not possible to get the results, proper results of Vipassana.
1:38 Without good samadhi, it is not possible to practice Vipassana.
1:43 Therefore, these three days you were observing your five precepts, the Sheela that you had taken on the first day, this was the foundation.
1:56 Stronger the foundation, the stronger the building will be on the foundation.
2:04 And with a strong foundation you started working with samadhi, practicing Anapanas.
2:13 Sheela is necessary to have right type of samadhi.
2:21 Even 25 centuries back in India, and so also to some extent even today,
2:29 there were teachers, there are teachers who give no importance to Sheela.
2:35 They say not necessary, you do whatever you like, whatever you feel pleasant to you, carry on.
2:42 But still you can meditate and get all the pleasant experiences of meditation.
2:52 The aim is to get some pleasant experience of meditation.
2:58 But Vipassana is not for that.
3:02 Vipassana is to get the mind purified, purified at the deepest level, at the root level,
3:10 for which not ordinary samadhi, but sammasamadhi is necessary, the right type of samadhi.
3:20 So perfect Sheela is necessary for right type of samadhi,
3:25 and right type of samadhi is necessary to develop panya.
3:32 And panya is necessary to reach the final goal of full liberation, full enlightenment.
3:39 Sheela for samadhi, samadhi for panya, panya for vimutti, that is liberation.
3:49 This is just when you start the work, but as you proceed,
3:54 you find all three of them, Sheela, samadhi, panya, they start helping each other.
4:02 It's like a tripod with three legs.
4:06 Even if one is weak, it can't stand. All three must be strong.
4:12 Sheela will help, samadhi will help, panya.
4:16 Samadhi will help, Sheela will help, panya.
4:19 Panya will help, Sheela will help, samadhi.
4:22 All three are interlinked and they start helping each other.
4:27 If one is perfect in Sheela, good.
4:33 It gives its own benefits, good results.
4:37 But merely having perfection in Sheela alone cannot take one to the final goal of full liberation.
4:47 One is perfect in Sheela and has very deep experience of samadhi,
4:54 yet this also cannot take to the goal of full liberation.
5:01 Panya is necessary.
5:04 This person who became fully enlightened, Siddhartha Gautama,
5:11 his life was full of Sheela even from the young age, childhood age,
5:18 and then he practiced samadhi, living the householder's life, he went to different teachers.
5:24 The highest samadhi of those days, eight absorption samadhis, he practiced all that.
5:34 And yet he found that he is not fully liberated,
5:39 because he noticed at the depth of the mind there are sleeping defilements,
5:48 which are like sleeping volcanoes.
5:51 So long as these volcanoes are there, they can erupt any time, will overpower you,
5:59 and again you will be full of misery.
6:03 Roots have to be taken out, roots of impurities at the depth of the mind has to be taken out,
6:09 and for that he continued his search and rediscovered this technique of vipassana.
6:19 This is panya.
6:21 Only by practicing vipassana he could develop his panya and become an enlightened person,
6:28 otherwise it would not have been impossible.
6:37 Vipassana was lost to the country.
6:45 Talk was there.
6:47 Panya was lost to the country in its perfection.
6:54 He rediscovered that.
6:59 Three parts of dhamma, the eightfold noble path in Sheela, which was there.
7:07 Three parts of samadhi, the eightfold path, were there.
7:15 Now another two parts which come under panya, that is samma sankappu,
7:24 samma tithi, samma sankappu, right type of thoughts.
7:32 When someone comes to a course like this, initially, at the surface level of the mind,
7:40 there are certain impurities which keeps one very agitated,
7:48 some impact on the mind of some incident,
7:52 and then one starts observing the respiration, the thoughts become very predominant,
7:58 and many a times the thoughts are full of defilements,
8:02 in some cases there might be anger, in some cases hatred,
8:07 in some cases lot of sadness, depression, in some cases maybe passion.
8:14 These thoughts keep on overpowering, and you try your best to come back to respiration,
8:19 thoughts keep on overpowering, you come to respiration,
8:22 one day, two days, three days you find, not that all the thoughts have gone away,
8:28 but the pattern of the thought has changed now.
8:32 It is not as violent as it was before.
8:37 Thoughts are still there, but now thoughts are mostly pertaining to dhamma,
8:46 pertaining to the path.
8:49 One starts understanding what the path is, how I should meditate,
8:54 what is the proper way of meditation, what are the difficulties,
8:58 all that keep coming in the mind, not the thoughts of harming somebody.
9:06 This is sammasankappu.
9:10 Still it is not the right type of panya which made him fully enlightened.
9:15 Good thoughts were there in the teaching of all the teachers of India,
9:20 before him, contemporary to him, and after him, have good thoughts.
9:27 They are necessary.
9:29 Then you can see things properly, and that is sammaditri, right understanding,
9:35 right view, you can see things properly, as they are.
9:41 Like the sun is covered with very dark clouds, black thick clouds,
9:51 and you don't see the light, it's all darkness.
9:55 Some layers of these clouds go away, clouds are still there,
10:00 but they are not so thick, not so dark, they are thin.
10:04 Light, you start seeing light, although all have not gone away.
10:09 That is necessary, this type of sammasankappu, thoughts are still there.
10:14 You have not reached the stage where the mind has become free from thinking,
10:17 free from thought, it is there.
10:20 But it is not that disturbance which won't allow you to take the next step,
10:24 and the next step is sammaditri, the right understanding,
10:29 understanding of the reality as it is.
10:34 And this is the real panya.
10:39 There are three stages of panya, wisdom, progressively.
10:48 One moves towards the panya which will liberate.
10:54 Three types of panya, in the language of those days,
10:58 it was called sutta maya panya, the next cinta maya panya,
11:05 and the third bhavana maya panya, sutta maya panya.
11:11 You heard something, you read something, wisdom of somebody else.
11:19 A wise person, an enlightened person, a saintly person, speaks words of dhamma,
11:27 they come in scriptures, you listen directly from this person,
11:32 or you read scriptures, and you accept it.
11:38 You accept it most of the time because you have got great faith and devotion in this person,
11:45 or you have got great faith and devotion in the scripture, particular scripture,
11:49 and you accept it. Good.
11:54 Very helpful.
11:57 Those who have never heard anything about dhamma, those who have never heard anything about the truth,
12:02 may remain confused the whole life.
12:05 At least one has heard about dhamma, has listened to dhamma, listened to the right things, correct things.
12:14 But this is not enough.
12:17 Just by developing sutta maya panya,
12:22 the wisdom that one heard from somebody or read somewhere cannot liberate you.
12:30 It is very good, very good in the sense that it will give you inspiration,
12:34 it will give you guidance to take the next step.
12:37 And the next step is cinta maya panya, which means understanding the truth,
12:45 developing the wisdom at the intellectual level.
12:51 Human being is a rational being.
12:55 He is not supposed to accept things blindly.
12:59 He must use his intellect, have reasoning, whatever I have heard, whatever I have read.
13:07 Is it logical? Is it pragmatic?
13:12 Shall I accept it?
13:15 At the intellectual level one tries to understand it and one finds at the intellectual level,
13:19 yes, it is quite logical, quite scientific, quite acceptable, and one accepts it.
13:26 The second step of panya, very important step.
13:32 Very helpful, helpful in the sense, again, you get inspiration
13:39 and you get a direction to move towards the third step,
13:45 which is bhavana maya panya.
13:49 Bhava is to happen, to live.
13:53 Your own wisdom, now you experienced, direct experience, you lived that wisdom,
13:59 and this alone will liberate you.
14:04 The first two will be helpful to you, but they cannot liberate you.
14:12 The first two were there in India at that time.
14:17 The discovery of Buddha was this third, experiencing.
14:23 There were all the talks there, there were teachers who will say,
14:30 keep yourself away from craving, keep yourself away from aversion,
14:34 all these sense objects, illusionary, delusionary, and you keep on getting attached to them,
14:43 you generate misery for yourself, come out of this attachment, become detached,
14:49 and you come out of misery. All those teachings were there, but how to come out?
14:56 Unless one has developed bhavana maya panya, the wisdom, with direct experience,
15:04 this starts helping one to come out of the misery.
15:12 First and the second can be very helpful, can be very harmful also.
15:20 Many a times they become very harmful, like sattvamaya panya.
15:28 Someone is born in a particular family, brought up in a particular society,
15:34 having faith in a particular tradition, particular scripture, belief.
15:42 From the young age one gets the mind conditioned, conditioned, conditioned,
15:48 all those acceptances, all those philosophies, beliefs, dogmas,
15:56 and one starts feeling that this is perfectly all right.
16:00 All other traditions are useless, they are not correct.
16:04 My tradition, this is the best, and I accept it.
16:10 One does not take the next step at all.
16:14 One feels perfectly satisfied, I have accepted the truth,
16:19 the truth that our scripture says, the truth that the saints have said,
16:23 the truth that the founder of our religion has said, it is wonderful.
16:30 That becomes a great barrier, a bondage.
16:33 Such person will never use the intellect, will never try to reason what is being taught.
16:40 Far away, to develop one's own ability to experience it is far away,
16:46 becomes a big bondage.
16:49 If someone who is convinced with the sattvamaya panya,
16:54 and yet being a human being, a human species, wants to reason out things,
17:01 and starts reasoning, is it true? Is it correct?
17:07 Is it acceptable? Is it pragmatic?
17:10 Then the elders get worried.
17:14 The elders of the family, the elders of the society,
17:19 the elders of this particular community, they don't like it.
17:25 They say, oh, you don't have belief, you don't have faith in our scriptures,
17:31 you don't have faith in the founder of our religion.
17:35 If you doubt, then you know what the result will be?
17:39 After death, she will go to hell.
17:42 And then a description of hell is given.
17:45 So terrible.
17:47 And he says, no, Baba, no. I don't like to go to that hell.
17:51 I accept reasonable or unreasonable, pragmatic or non-pragmatic, anything.
17:55 I accept. I don't want to go to hell.
17:58 So poor fellow, he accepts it, accepts it out of fear.
18:04 Same very elders, they go another way, and they will say,
18:08 look, if you accept whatever is written in our scriptures,
18:12 whatever our tradition says, our philosophy says, if you accept it,
18:16 then you know what will happen.
18:18 After death, you will get heaven.
18:20 And then a wonderful description of heaven.
18:22 So wonderful, so wonderful.
18:25 You will enjoy all the sensual pleasures there, celestial pleasures,
18:30 so wonderful, which you can't get in this world.
18:34 The mouth starts watering, wonderful.
18:37 If I get that, I accept everything.
18:40 I don't mind accepting.
18:42 By accepting, if I get that heaven, I am the first person to accept.
18:46 You accept it.
18:49 So you accept it either out of blind faith, or you accept out of fear,
18:55 or you accept out of greed.
18:57 You are just accepting.
19:00 You are not using your grey matter to understand what it is.
19:06 And somebody has taken the next step.
19:10 That also can become a big bondage.
19:13 Many a times it so happens.
19:16 You start reasoning, you find very logical.
19:19 And especially the belief of your own tradition,
19:23 like a good lawyer, you will find so many ways of convincing yourself,
19:28 this is correct.
19:30 Our tradition says so-so, it is correct.
19:33 You keep on arguing, arguing yourself, and get yourself convinced.
19:37 Yes, this is correct.
19:40 And that is the end of it.
19:42 Now I know everything.
19:44 My intellect says this is correct.
19:47 And you inflate ego.
19:52 I know everything now.
19:54 I am such a wise person.
19:57 I can write books upon books on this philosophy, on this belief.
20:02 I can give lectures.
20:04 I can have debates, arguments, discussions to prove that every other belief is wrong.
20:09 This belief is correct.
20:11 And this madness will not allow him to take the next step.
20:16 So these two can become big hindrance.
20:22 If one starts taking the step in the Bhava Namaya Panya,
20:27 then you start experiencing the reality yourself.
20:33 So long as you are not experienced, the reality is no reality for you.
20:39 It is always distorted.
20:43 Each individual has to experience the truth oneself to reach the final goal.
20:51 This person, Siddhartha Gautama,
20:54 he realized the truth within himself, developed his Bhava Namaya Panya,
21:01 and became an enlightened person, became a liberated person.
21:05 This Panya that is developed within himself could liberate only one person, not two.
21:11 And that one person was Gautama, Siddhartha Gautama, none else.
21:16 None else can liberate it because of his wisdom.
21:20 Others can get guidance, others can get inspiration, that's alright.
21:25 But each individual has to develop one's own wisdom to reach the final goal of full liberation.
21:33 One's own wisdom, Bhava Namaya Panya, the wisdom that you lived, you experienced.
21:41 This alone can break the bondages of ignorance, of craving, of aversion, of negativity.
21:50 This alone can eradicate all the miseries.
21:53 This gives fruit, not the first, not the second.
21:58 An example, someone very hungry has gone to a restaurant,
22:08 got his seat, menu is placed before him, he goes through that menu,
22:16 ah, wonderful, the food prepared today is very delicious, his mouth starts watering, wonderful.
22:25 One incident, now he orders for the food, it will take some time before it's served.
22:31 And he looks around, people who had come earlier, they are already served food and they are taking their food,
22:36 and they are enjoying it. Certainly the food is very delicious today.
22:41 Look, everybody is enjoying. Again the mouth starts watering.
22:44 Second incident, third incident, the food is served to this person and he starts enjoying it.
22:52 The first was Shatmaya Panya, that menu card only he had read, he had not tasted it.
22:58 The second Chintamaya Panya is intellect sees, because he has seen people when they enjoy something,
23:03 their facial expressions are of this type, and look, these people are enjoying because their facial expressions say that they are enjoying it.
23:11 Certainly, it must be very delicious. He has not tasted it himself.
23:16 Only the third time when it was given to him, he started eating it, tasting it, then yes, he started really enjoying it.
23:25 This is Bhavanamaya Panya.
23:28 The first and the second cannot make you taste the reality.
23:33 Another example, someone is sick, goes to a doctor, doctor examines, and then writes medicine, a prescription on a paper.
23:46 Very happy, comes back home, has great faith in the doctor, nothing wrong, one must have faith in one's doctor, physician.
23:56 But how this one, this faith becomes blind faith, devotion becomes blind devotion.
24:01 In his house, on the altar, he places a statue of the doctor, picture of the doctor,
24:09 and offers sweet, and fruits, and flowers, and incense, and then makes 108 rounds around it, and bows down three times.
24:21 What does that tell? Takes out that piece of paper and keeps on reciting.
24:28 One pill in the morning, one pill in the afternoon, one pill in the evening, one pill in the morning, one pill in the afternoon.
24:35 What does one get? Madness.
24:38 This is what happens when the faith becomes blind faith, the devotion becomes blind devotion.
24:44 Alright, second incident.
24:46 After all, a human being, a rational being, so he runs to the doctor, why you gave me this piece of paper, and what is this, how will it help me?
24:54 The doctor is an intelligent fellow, he says, well look, this is your disease, and this is the cause of the disease.
25:01 If you take this medicine, this cause will get eradicated.
25:05 When the cause gets eradicated, your sickness gets eradicated.
25:09 Ah, wonderful, now I understand, my doctor is so wonderful, his medicine is so wonderful, and what he does now?
25:17 Coming back home, he starts fighting with all the neighbours, useless, your doctors are all useless, my doctor is wonderful.
25:24 The medicine suggested by your doctors is useless, the medicine suggested by my doctor is wonderful.
25:31 Keeps on fighting, doesn't take medicine, keeps on fighting.
25:36 Oh, this is what happens.
25:39 Every wise person, a saintly person, an enlightened person, when he finds people miserable, suffering,
25:48 then he gives this prescription of Dhamma.
25:51 You practice Sheela, you practice Samadhi, you practice Panya, you will come out of your misery.
25:57 Nobody tries to practice.
26:01 They start different sects, beliefs, dogmas, rites, rituals, and get involved in that, and nobody practices.
26:09 No benefit.
26:11 And the third Panya, Bhavanamaya Panya, is to apply Dhamma in life by direct experience.
26:18 It is only this which gives the benefit, your own direct experience.
26:25 Now the difficulty comes, how to have direct experience?
26:31 Direct experience of this mind-matter phenomena, how a constant interaction is going on,
26:42 and because of that, how the negativity gets originated and then starts multiplying, starts overpowering you,
26:51 and how with the understanding of that you can stop the arising of this negativity,
26:57 even if it is a reason, you won't allow it to multiply and overpower you.
27:01 All that has to be experienced.
27:04 And that is, all that is happening at the depth of the mind.
27:11 You must develop a faculty, an ability, capability to experience it.
27:17 These three days, this is what you were doing.
27:20 Unless you have that capability, that faculty, you can't practice Vipassana. Not possible.
27:27 Like if you don't have your eye faculty, you can't see anything.
27:31 If you don't have your ear sense faculty, you can't hear anything.
27:35 Similarly, this mind faculty which takes you to the depth of the mind and matter interaction,
27:42 unless you have this faculty, you can't.
27:46 An example, two friends, young boys, very poor, live the life of beggar.
27:57 They go round and beg food. One of them is blind, birth blind.
28:03 One day it so happened that this friend who was blind, birth blind, he had very high fever.
28:09 So the other friend said, alright, you stay here.
28:12 I will go round and beg food and then we shall eat together.
28:16 He went. And it so happened that day, a housewife felt very compassionate
28:23 and she offered a very sweet dish.
28:29 In our country we call it kheer, a pudding prepared from milk and rice and dry fruits and sweet etc.
28:39 This was offered. He was very happy.
28:43 He enjoyed it. But this is liquid and he has no container to take for his friend.
28:49 So he could not bring to the friend.
28:52 Came back and very honestly told him, today in the begging I got this kheer.
28:57 So delicious. But sorry, I could not bring for you. I had no container.
29:04 Alright, you didn't bring, you didn't bring. But tell me, what is this kheer?
29:08 You don't know what is kheer? I don't know what is kheer.
29:11 Oh, it is white. It was made of milk, so white. White.
29:16 What is white? You don't know what is white? I don't know what is white.
29:21 It is not black. But what is black?
29:24 You don't know white? You don't know black? What sort of person you are?
29:28 I don't know. I don't know what is white, what is black?
29:31 Birth blind. How can I know what is white, what is black?
29:35 He was looking here and there and he saw one white duck, caught hold of it, and brought.
29:40 Look, white like this duck. White like this duck.
29:44 He has no eyes. How can he see what is white and what is this duck?
29:48 He uses his fingertips, passes his hand over this duck.
29:52 Ah, now I understand what is white. White is very soft, very soft.
29:59 What soft? What softness has got to do with white?
30:02 You said it is like this duck and I touched it, it is so soft.
30:06 Now you say white is not soft. How can I understand what is white?
30:10 Oh, you mad fellow. I told you white is like this duck and you can't understand it.
30:17 All right, let me examine again. And he examines again.
30:20 From the beak he starts up to the end of the plume, the whole body.
30:25 Ah, now I understand. It is crooked. White is crooked.
30:31 So, for all those people who talk of high philosophies, high philosophies,
30:36 but have never experienced anything because they don't have the faculty to experience it,
30:40 for them the truth is always crooked.
30:43 The whole life the truth will remain crooked, crooked, crooked. They can't understand.
30:48 This faculty to experience the truth is very important and this is what you started doing.
30:56 If you are just working with your Sheila and don't take the next step of Samadhi,
31:03 you would not have got this faculty.
31:05 You started with Samadhi and if you had worked with the Samadhi,
31:09 with some object of imagination, verbalization, visualization,
31:14 again you would not have got this faculty because you worked with the reality.
31:18 Reality pertaining to your own mind, matter, phenomena.
31:22 And you started working on this area with the breath which is truth and you are experiencing it.
31:27 Then the touch of the breath, you are experiencing it and now the third day you started feeling sensations.
31:33 The biochemical reactions here, this is how you are going to the deeper levels of your own mind.
31:40 The deepest level of the mind, what is called the unconscious. Mind is actually not unconscious.
31:47 This is all the time conscious, day and night, but conscious of the sensations on the body that you started experiencing here.
31:55 Such sensations are there throughout the body.
31:58 Throughout the body something or the other is happening, something or the other is happening,
32:02 some change is taking place, a change with the manifestation of this sensation or a change with the manifestation of that sensation,
32:09 but some change is going on.
32:11 And that can be experienced only by whatever you did for these three days.
32:15 A beginning is made. Tomorrow you will explore the entire field and you will find everywhere some sensation or the other.
32:22 This is how you are moving from the surface level of your mind to the depth of the mind.
32:27 Where deep rooted complexes from the past are all accumulated there.
32:32 Where lies the behavior pattern of your mind, the deepest level of your mind.
32:37 And the behavior pattern of this mind is to react.
32:40 Whenever it feels any pleasant sensation on the body, it reacts with craving, with clinging.
32:46 Whenever it experiences any unpleasant sensation on the body, it reacts with aversion, with hatred.
32:54 You are moving towards that, moving towards that.
32:59 At the intellectual level it is very easy, it is very easy to understand that there is a change taking place everywhere.
33:09 And everything is so impermanent.
33:12 Anyone who takes birth dies.
33:15 Anything that is manufactured later or sooner or later gets destroyed.
33:19 Everything is impermanent.
33:22 But that is an intellectual understanding.
33:25 Experience of it can be only within the framework of your body.
33:30 The law of nature is law of nature everywhere, inside, outside.
33:34 But the law of nature that you see outside can be acceptable, can be understood at the intellectual level.
33:41 But the reality, the law that you experience within the framework of the body can be experienced.
33:47 And this experience is called Bhavanamaya Panya.
33:51 You are living there, your direct experience.
33:54 Otherwise it does not help at the intellectual level.
33:59 There were teachers before Buddha, at the time of Buddha, after Buddha, who kept on giving the same teaching.
34:07 But it didn't work to the depth as it worked for people who started developing their own Bhavanamaya Panya.
34:15 Like something very traumatic happens in the life.
34:18 A very near or dear one has passed away.
34:23 And you take his dead body to the funeral pyre and burn it.
34:31 Or to the graveyard and put it in the grave.
34:34 While that is going on, one develops so much of wisdom.
34:38 After all, everything is so impermanent.
34:44 One who takes birth dies.
34:47 Nobody is free from death.
34:51 I will also die one day.
34:53 People will bring my body, put it in this grave, or burn on this funeral pyre.
34:58 Then what is the use of all this craving, craving, clinging, fighting with people, accumulating this or that?
35:06 Ultimately everything will be left here and my body will be burned.
35:11 Big wisdom. But how long?
35:14 As soon as one takes one step out of that graveyard, again the same, I, I, mine, mine.
35:20 All madness is there. Makes no difference.
35:23 It was only an intellectual understanding.
35:26 Or people come to such Dhamma talks, such discourses.
35:30 Ah, wonderful. Now I understand why this attachment is so bad, it gives so much of misery.
35:37 The more you are attached, the more miserable you are bound to be.
35:40 Misery, misery. This I is a big misery.
35:43 Mine is a big misery, big misery.
35:47 At the end of the discourse, when you go out of the hall,
35:51 Hey, where are my shoes? Who has taken away? My slippers I purchased only today.
35:55 New ones, what happened?
35:57 Start crying, crying, mine, mine, mine.
36:00 Makes no difference.
36:02 It is all intellectual. Doesn't help.
36:06 One has to experience.
36:08 And it is so difficult to experience.
36:11 So easy to understand at the intellectual level.
36:14 So easy to accept it at the devotional level.
36:17 So difficult to experience.
36:19 Because unless you have that faculty to experience, you can't.
36:23 There is so much of illusion, so much of delusion.
36:27 At the apparent level something appears to be so, seems to be so.
36:31 Actual level is totally different.
36:35 Like night time you go to bed.
36:38 You lit a lamp or a candle.
36:41 You go to sleep. Next morning you get up.
36:44 And you see the candle, the light of the candle, the light of the lamp.
36:49 And you are under the impression the same candle, the same light.
36:52 Where the same candle? Where the same light?
36:56 Every moment a flame arises and passes away, another takes its place and passes away,
37:01 another takes its place and passes away.
37:03 There is no interval. Continuously.
37:06 And that gives the impression the same flame, the same light, the same flame, the same light.
37:12 A big illusion.
37:15 This electric bulb, I pointed towards it twice.
37:21 One remains under the impression the same light, the same light.
37:25 Where the same light?
37:27 If it was the same light, then why at the end of the month
37:31 this electric company sends me a bill.
37:34 You consume so many units, so many dollars, what for?
37:37 My light I purchased in the market, my switch.
37:40 On it I get my light. Who are you? What for you want money?
37:46 He is quite correct. He is generating there electricity.
37:49 It comes through the wires, gets consumed, new takes its place with such great rapidity.
37:54 The old one passes away, the new takes its place, the old one passes away with such great rapidity.
37:59 It gives the impression the same, the same.
38:03 Another example.
38:06 You cross the river.
38:08 Morning you cross the river, went to the other bank of the river,
38:11 whole day you worked there and then again you took the boat and came on this side of the river.
38:16 You are under the impression I have crossed the same river.
38:20 Where the same river?
38:22 Even if you take a dip in this river, you take a dip and the head above the water,
38:27 second dip, head above the water, third dip, head above the water,
38:31 you are under the impression that I am taking a dip in the same river.
38:34 Where the same river? Constant flow is there.
38:38 The dip that you had in the river is gone. Not a single drop remains, all are gone.
38:43 Second dip in a second river altogether.
38:46 Third dip in a third river altogether.
38:49 The morning you cross this river by your boat, by evening it was a totally new river.
38:55 And yet the impression remains the same, the same river, the same light.
39:00 How to come out of this?
39:03 Certain things which are within the capacity of your sense organs,
39:09 you have got eyes and you can see things, there is a limitation for that.
39:13 The flame of the lamp arising, passing, arising, passing.
39:18 If you see very carefully you can notice yes, arising, passing, arising, passing.
39:23 But the light of electricity, it arises and passes in such a great rapidity beyond your eyes capacity.
39:30 The flow of the river, yes it is flowing.
39:33 The second dip is a new river, third dip is a new river.
39:37 If you give attention you can understand.
39:39 But how to understand?
39:42 This fellow who took the first dip is gone.
39:45 Second dip is taken by altogether a new person.
39:48 Third dip is taken by altogether a new person.
39:51 How to understand that?
39:53 You don't have that faculty to experience it.
39:56 If one has not practiced Vipassana, then this Goenka,
40:01 we started talking about half an hour ago, will remain under the impression the same Goenka.
40:06 And the same Goenka.
40:08 The same Goenka was yesterday.
40:10 The same Goenka was one year ago, or ten years ago, fifty years ago, sixty years ago, sixty seven years ago, same Goenka.
40:18 The same Goenka.
40:20 Every moment this Goenka is dying, another Goenka is taking birth.
40:24 Every moment this Goenka is dying, another Goenka is taking birth.
40:28 The entire physical structure made of these subatomic particles,
40:31 arising, passing, arising, passing, with such great rapidity, such great rapidity.
40:37 This speed creates illusion, delusion, confusion.
40:42 One cannot understand the reality.
40:45 Even if one accepts the reality at the intellectual level,
40:48 because the scientists have said so,
40:51 the entire material world, there is no solidity.
40:55 There is only wavelets, wavelets, wavelets.
40:58 The modern scientists say so.
41:00 Well, an enlightened person like a Buddha has said so.
41:03 There is no solidity anywhere.
41:05 Just wavelets, entire universe, mind and matter, nothing but wavelets, vibration, vibration.
41:11 Because you have got faith in them and you accept.
41:14 That doesn't help.
41:16 You have to experience yourself.
41:18 And this is what was done by him to reach the final goal of full liberation.
41:23 And this is what everyone has to do to understand the real change taking place.
41:29 Every moment changing, changing, changing, with great rapidity, changing.
41:36 A child is born.
41:39 You see the child, beautiful, tender.
41:42 You see the child after 10 years, a big change has come.
41:46 And you see with the interval of 20 years, big change, 30, 40, 60, 80 years, unbelievable.
41:54 The same child. How he became like this?
41:57 And how he became like this?
41:59 Not that at the end of every 10 years he went to bed
42:02 and some God Almighty passed a magic wand over his body and he got a changed person.
42:08 Nothing doing.
42:09 Every moment change is taking place, every moment changing, changing, changing,
42:14 decaying, decaying, growing, decaying, growing, decaying.
42:17 This is the law of nature.
42:20 This law of nature, if one accepts at the intellectual level or at the devotional level,
42:26 does not help at all.
42:28 It is just an intellectual pleasure, intellectual entertainment,
42:32 or a devotional pleasure, a devotional entertainment, it won't help.
42:36 But at the actual level when one starts experiencing it,
42:40 it makes such a big difference, such a big difference.
42:44 And this is what he did.
42:46 What you have started doing is just a very tiny step, it's a long path.
42:52 One has to investigate so much deep inside to understand what this material structure is,
42:58 what this mind is, and what interaction is going on at a very deep level.
43:04 And this made him fully enlightened.
43:07 Dividing, dissecting, disintegrating, dissolving, dissolving,
43:12 he reached the stage where he came to the ultimate truth pertaining to the matter,
43:17 the ultimate truth pertaining to the mind,
43:20 the ultimate truth pertaining to the mental contents,
43:23 the mental concomitants which arise with the mind.
43:26 And then it transcended that and experienced something which is beyond mind and matter.
43:31 What the matter? Dividing, dissecting, dividing, dissecting,
43:35 he came to the tiniest subatomic particle of which the entire body is made,
43:40 the tiniest to which he gave a name Kalapa.
43:45 Kalapa means a unit, a material unit, tiniest material unit which cannot be further separated.
43:52 He called it Attha Kalapa.
43:54 Attha means eight, eight things joined together make this unit,
43:58 and these eight things cannot be separated, they are always together.
44:02 The four basic elements like earth, water, fire, air,
44:06 and each one has its own characteristic joined together, eight.
44:11 These characteristics are more important, and that can be experienced.
44:17 When one reaches to that stage,
44:20 then it becomes easy to understand the mind also at the ultimate level.
44:27 This is the reality of the mind at the ultimate level.
44:30 This is the reality of every mental content at the ultimate level.
44:34 And this made him understand what is this mind-matter phenomenon.
44:42 With such a great rapidity, all wavelets, wavelets, wavelets,
44:47 but with such a great rapidity, things arise, pass, arise, pass, arise, pass.
44:52 He says, by the time I snap my fingers,
44:55 or by the time I blink,
44:58 this tiny little subatomic particle arises, passes, arises, passes,
45:04 trillions of times, trillions of times.
45:09 A western scientist also has come to the same conclusion.
45:14 A professor in Berkeley University,
45:19 he was studying, trying to understand how this atom is working.
45:25 This was clear to the scientists of the West a century ago,
45:29 that there is no solidity in the material world, mere wavelets, wavelets, wavelets.
45:34 He was eager to know, very inquisitive to know,
45:37 the tiniest particle, how many times it arises and passes, arises and passes in one second.
45:44 And to find out that, he invented an instrument,
45:49 which he very rightly called bubble chamber.
45:52 Like bubble, it arises, passes, arises, passes.
45:55 And with the help of this bubble chamber, he could find out and then announce
46:00 that this tiniest atom, it arises and passes in one second,
46:06 22 zeros after one, 22 zeros after one.
46:11 And here, another scientist in the East says,
46:15 that by the time I snap my fingers or blink my eyes,
46:19 trillions of times it arises and passes, arises and passes.
46:23 They came to the same conclusion.
46:26 And yet, what a great difference, what a great difference.
46:31 Quite a few students from this part of the world, California, Berkeley,
46:36 they came to India, took courses when they heard about this professor,
46:40 and he is a very renowned professor, he passed away recently,
46:43 and he got Nobel Prize, and Nobel Prize is not given to any Tom, Dick and Harry.
46:47 Somebody must have invented something which people didn't know.
46:50 So he was a very famous man.
46:52 So out of inquisitiveness, they went, curiosity to see this person,
46:56 who reached the stage which an enlightened person reached,
46:59 and they found him a bundle of misery, full of tension.
47:03 Why he could not come out of his misery?
47:06 Why he could not come out of his tension,
47:08 whereas somebody coming to the same conclusion,
47:11 got free from all miseries?
47:14 Because Bhavana Maya Panya was missing.
47:18 He had come to this conclusion with the help of his apparatus,
47:22 his instrument, the bubble chamber.
47:24 He has great faith in this bubble chamber.
47:26 He has great faith in his own intellect, and he says it is so.
47:30 But this person is not using any scientific instrument or apparatus,
47:35 only his experience, direct experience, and this makes all the difference.
47:40 When you go deep inside to understand the reality of your mind and matter interaction,
47:45 it is not for the sake of curiosity,
47:49 not to quench the thirst of your inquisitiveness.
47:52 The purpose of it is to come out of the ignorance and see how,
47:56 out of ignorance you keep on generating impurity after impurity,
48:01 defilement after defilement, negativity after negativity,
48:04 and you become a bundle of misery.
48:06 To change that habit pattern, one has to go deep inside, deep inside,
48:10 and experience the truth.
48:13 The first truth which one starts experiencing is the truth of change.
48:20 Every moment a change is taking place.
48:23 The entire mind-matter phenomena, constantly changing, changing, changing,
48:29 and that is understood at the experiential level.
48:33 Everything is changing, changing, changing.
48:38 There is nothing throughout the physical structure or the mental structure
48:42 as you keep on dividing, dissecting, disintegrating, dissolving,
48:46 nothing which you can say, this is the hard core, and now this remains permanent.
48:51 You keep on exploring. If there is any hard core, let me see, let me experience it,
48:56 and this is what the Bhavanamaya Panya will do.
48:59 The change, the anicca, the change is experienced now.
49:03 The change is not accepted merely at the level of intellect,
49:07 not accepted merely at the level of devotion, at the actual level.
49:11 Change, change, change.
49:14 Initially you come across very solidified, intense, apparent reality.
49:23 This body, so solidified, made of bones and flesh, etc., etc.
49:29 And what you feel on the body, all solidified, intense, like pressure,
49:34 like heaviness, like numbness, like heat, like pain, all solidified and intensified.
49:41 As you started observing here, you will start observing things throughout the body
49:45 and you observe objectively, objectively.
49:48 Not that all the time you will observe objectively, it takes time,
49:51 but you start working on that, few moments you get when you observe really objectively, objectively.
49:56 And as you are observing objectively, objectively, you find the mind is becoming sharper and sharper.
50:03 And as the mind becomes sharper and sharper, it starts experiencing subtler and subtler reality.
50:09 The intensity, through the intensities, through the solidity, you start piercing, penetrating,
50:14 and you start experiencing subtler reality, subtler reality, subtler reality,
50:18 until one reaches the experience where the entire material structure,
50:25 the entire mental structure is nothing but vibrations, vibrations arising, passing, arising, passing,
50:31 bubbles arising, passing, wavelets arising, passing, arising, passing,
50:36 constant flow, constant flux.
50:40 Then you are experiencing the truth of impermanence.
50:45 It is not merely an intellectual game. It is not merely an emotional or devotional game.
50:51 It's the actual experience of the truth, that what you experience within the framework of the body
50:57 is a constant flux, a constant flow, every moment changing, changing, changing, changing.
51:05 Then the madness goes away. Madness of what?
51:09 Madness of attachment towards this physical structure.
51:13 Madness of attachments towards this mental structure, the combination of the two,
51:18 something which is so ephemeral.
51:21 What purpose will be served by developing craving towards it, developing aversion towards it,
51:28 and one learns how to observe, observe equanimously, equanimously, equanimously?
51:32 Old habit pattern was to react.
51:35 This very mind-matter phenomena generating this sensation or that sensation, pleasant or unpleasant,
51:41 reaction is there, craving or aversion, craving or aversion, you lose the balance of the mind,
51:45 you become very agitated, and now this first part of wisdom, anicca,
51:51 will become clearer and clearer at the experiential level.
51:57 As one develops this part of the Vishnum, anicca, anicca, anicca,
52:03 everything changing, changing, changing,
52:07 another part of wisdom will raise itself.
52:12 Dukha or misery.
52:16 Initially when you start practicing, observing the reality about yourself,
52:20 coming across very solidified, intensified realities, the sensations which are very painful,
52:26 heavy, numbness, pressure, tension, etc., obviously it is misery.
52:33 It is so miserable. You don't like it, you want to get rid of it, and it is there.
52:37 But you are trained to observe. However misery it is, you just observe.
52:41 However unpleasant it is, just observe, just observe.
52:44 And people reach the stage, sometimes on the seventh day or eighth day or ninth day or tenth day,
52:52 or maybe in two courses or three courses, they reach a stage where all the solidity gets dissolved,
52:58 and there is a very free flow of subtle vibrations throughout the body,
53:02 energy flowing throughout the body, and it looks so pleasant, so pleasant.
53:07 Ah, wonderful. This is bliss. This is ecstasy.
53:13 I was looking for it. Now I got my goal.
53:17 And you develop so much of attachment to it. Ah, I got it. I got it.
53:22 Without understanding this is equally impermanent, changing, changing.
53:27 Morning you had a wonderful experience of a flow of energy throughout the body.
53:31 And afternoon it changed. And you again have pains and heaviness and numbness.
53:36 And you come to your teacher or your assistant teacher and say,
53:39 Oh, wonderful. Morning meditation was so wonderful, and now it is so bad.
53:44 You become so miserable because you developed attachment to something which was so impermanent.
53:49 Then it becomes so clear that not only unpleasant sensations are misery,
53:54 the pleasant sensations are also misery because there is a tendency of your developing attachment to it.
54:00 And every attachment is synonymous to misery.
54:03 You are bound to feel miserable because whatever you are attached to is not permanent.
54:09 It is impermanent, bound to change sooner or later.
54:12 This becomes clearer and clearer.
54:15 The dukkha, not the dukkha of the pains, etc., but the dukkha of even pleasant sensations in your body.
54:23 The third part of panya will raise its head. It will become so clear.
54:28 Anatta, no I, no mine.
54:33 It appears to be so. There is an I in me.
54:37 It appears to be so. This is mine.
54:40 But then as you proceed further, at the experiential level, not at the intellectual level,
54:46 it becomes so clear. What is I?
54:50 You explore the entire field of matter within you, the entire field of mind,
54:55 the combination of the two, and nothing but wavelets, wavelets, wavelets,
54:59 bubbles, bubbles, bubbles arising, passing.
55:02 Now which bubble is I? This bubble is I.
55:05 It has gone away. So I am gone away. Which wavelet? Which wavelet is I? It is gone.
55:09 So I am gone. Which wavelet?
55:11 For conventional purpose we have to use these words, I, mine, you, yours.
55:17 Actually there is no I, no mine.
55:20 You have to use these words. Otherwise how can you say,
55:23 this mass of bubble talking to that mass of bubble.
55:26 It doesn't work. You have to use these words, I, mine, you, you are, he, she, etc.
55:31 That is apparent truth. It appears to be so.
55:34 This is also true. But the ultimate truth, the real truth is
55:37 nothing but wavelets, wavelets, vibrations, vibrations, bubbles.
55:42 A senseless, this anatta.
55:45 If there is really I, or if there is really mine, something mine,
55:51 I must have possession over it. What possession I have got?
55:55 What possession I have got?
55:58 At the age of about 40, one looks the face in the mirror
56:03 and sees some grey hair. Grey hair. I am getting grey? Oh no!
56:08 And runs to the chemist shop, buys some dye, hair dye and uses it.
56:12 I am young. I am still young. Tries to deceive others.
56:16 Tries to deceive oneself. But how to deceive this nature?
56:21 The law, the dhamma, one is greying.
56:25 One is decaying, decaying, decaying, dying, dying, dying.
56:30 Every moment you are dying, you are dying, you are dying.
56:34 If you control, if you are master of your own physical structure,
56:37 you say, no, you can't decay. You must remain as I want you to remain.
56:41 Nothing doing. You are helpless. It is decaying, decaying, decaying.
56:45 Without understanding this phenomenon, constantly changing phenomenon,
56:51 one feels so happy. I am 20 years old, birthday party,
56:57 big celebration, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you.
57:03 Poor chap doesn't understand. He is 20 years nearer his graveyard.
57:08 What happy? This does not mean that whenever your birthday comes,
57:12 you start crying, I am nearer one year to my... Oh no!
57:15 Dhamma does not teach you to cry. You understand the reality.
57:19 This is the fact. So many time is gone now.
57:22 Whatever is left, I don't know how much is left. Whatever is left,
57:25 what best use I can make? What best use I can make?
57:29 Well, this is wisdom. When anatta becomes clear,
57:32 when anicca has become clear, changing, changing, changing,
57:35 dukkha has become clear, anatta has become clear,
57:38 then you are developing, you are getting established in wisdom.
57:42 Step by step you are moving towards your final goal.
57:45 Then in day to day life you find your wisdom is manifesting itself
57:51 in your dealing with people, dealing with situation.
57:55 You will understand. This is the apparent truth.
57:58 And you have to deal with the world at the level of apparent truth.
58:02 You can't say this wall is just mass of vibrations and wavelets.
58:06 My leg is also just wavelet. I kick it and my leg will go just out of it.
58:11 Doesn't happen. It will break your leg.
58:14 So at the apparent level it is true, it's solid wall and this is also solid.
58:18 But at the ultimate level, mere vibration, vibration,
58:22 vibration, this is also mere vibration, vibration,
58:25 so that you don't develop attachment towards it.
58:29 And when that starts happening, you learn how to observe things
58:33 not just in a solidified reality, apparent reality.
58:38 Apparent reality is so, solidified reality.
58:41 You will feel like dividing it, dissecting it, disintegrating it,
58:46 and see the ultimate truth.
58:49 When one does not have proper wisdom
58:53 and a man looks at the solidified body of a woman,
58:58 ah, so beautiful, so beautiful.
59:01 Or a woman looks at the solidified body of a man,
59:03 oh, so beautiful, so beautiful.
59:06 When you develop in Dhamma, you will try to understand what beautiful.
59:10 Let me see. Let me divide, dissect, disintegrate and see what's beautiful.
59:14 You start from the top of the head.
59:17 The hairs, ah, beautiful, blonde hair, or brunette hair,
59:21 or silken hair, or dark hair, or this hair or that hair.
59:25 One hair has come out.
59:28 What beauty? You feel like throwing it away.
59:32 Poor girl, as she was preparing breakfast,
59:35 a part of this grass fell in the breakfast.
59:38 And he offered to the hubby.
59:41 And the hubby found out, hair, oh, dirty hair, you spoiled my breakfast.
59:46 Whole evening, whole night you were praising, beautiful hair, beautiful hair.
59:50 Nowadays, come with your food. Eat it. Why shout?
59:55 It was beautiful only when it was integrated.
59:59 When it remained integrated, it was beautiful.
1:00:02 The moment got disintegrated, you know, no beauty.
1:00:06 What else is beautiful? Move further.
1:00:10 You come to the teeth, ah, wonderful, so beautiful.
1:00:14 Rows of pearls, pearls.
1:00:17 One tooth has come out, broken.
1:00:20 A pearl has come out, a valuable pearl.
1:00:23 Keep it in the safe, in the treasury.
1:00:26 Throw it away, the piece of bone, it's a piece of bone,
1:00:29 the moment it gets disintegrated.
1:00:32 When it is integrated, it is a pearl, valuable pearl, a row of pearl.
1:00:35 And what else, as you move further?
1:00:38 Oh, these nails, so beautiful nails.
1:00:41 And so well nail-polished.
1:00:44 To suit the color of the skin or to suit the color of the gown or the sari.
1:00:47 So beautiful, so beautiful.
1:00:50 And the same story, poor girl, she was clipping her nails,
1:00:53 and some part of these nails fell in the food.
1:00:56 And the husband, so, nails, dirty nails. What dirty nails?
1:00:59 Beautiful nails, beautiful nail-polished,
1:01:02 and your food is so beautiful, joined together, doubly beautiful.
1:01:05 Eat it.
1:01:08 What beautiful?
1:01:11 What is beautiful?
1:01:14 A student comes to me and says,
1:01:17 in the West, you know what we say is beautiful,
1:01:20 tell me what is beautiful.
1:01:23 Please don't talk about these things.
1:01:26 In the West we say beauty is one-sixteenth of an inch deep.
1:01:29 This skin looks so glossy, so smooth.
1:01:32 This is beauty, you see.
1:01:35 If you throw it away, you can't keep it.
1:01:38 What beautiful?
1:01:41 Is there anything beautiful inside?
1:01:44 If there was anything beautiful, it should come out through this hole or that hole.
1:01:47 From which hole, what beauty comes out?
1:01:50 What beauty comes out?
1:01:53 The nature is really very kind to us.
1:01:56 Otherwise, if whatever is inside, it was outside,
1:01:59 and whatever is outside, it was inside.
1:02:02 That's our condition.
1:02:05 Fighting with the crows, the eagles, the vultures, the dogs,
1:02:08 life would have been horrible.
1:02:11 What is beautiful?
1:02:14 This does not mean that Dhamma will teach you that you start hating people.
1:02:17 Oh, you, not beautiful, you are ugly, you are mass of bubble.
1:02:20 I am also mass of bubble.
1:02:23 Dhamma will not teach hatred.
1:02:26 As you go deeper and deeper and understanding, develop your panya,
1:02:29 and pure mind is full of love, infinite love,
1:02:32 full of compassion, infinite compassion,
1:02:35 full of joy, sympathetic joy,
1:02:38 infinite sympathetic joy,
1:02:41 and infinite equanimity, balance.
1:02:44 You can't hate anybody.
1:02:47 Mere love, goodwill, compassion, love, goodwill.
1:02:50 The path takes us to that stage
1:02:53 where we come out of our misery, we come out of our defilements,
1:02:56 and live a real liberated life,
1:02:59 an enlightened life, a good life, good for us, and good for others,
1:03:02 for which each individual has to work.
1:03:05 Good that you have come here to work.
1:03:08 You made a proper preparation these three days,
1:03:11 and tomorrow you will be entering the field of panya,
1:03:14 starting vipashyana.
1:03:17 But understand, when you start vipashyana, don't expect
1:03:20 that as soon as you start observing the reality, you will see
1:03:23 the force of atomic particles arising and passing.
1:03:26 Oh, no, no, no. Initially you will have all these pains
1:03:29 and pressures and heaviness, and slowly
1:03:32 you will get disintegrated, disintegrated.
1:03:35 You will feel a flow of energy, but don't expect anything.
1:03:38 Let it happen as it happens, from moment to moment,
1:03:41 from moment to moment. Just accept the reality
1:03:44 from moment to moment, from moment to moment, and leave it to nature.
1:03:47 Leave it to dhamma. You just accept
1:03:50 at this moment, within the framework of your body,
1:03:53 free from all imaginations, free from all verbalization,
1:03:56 free from all visualizations, the reality as it is
1:03:59 pertaining to your mind-matter phenomenon.
1:04:02 And certainly, this technique will help you
1:04:05 and take you to the final goal.
1:04:08 Make best use of the time.
1:04:11 The wonderful time you have given ten days of your life,
1:04:14 you must get best result of these ten days,
1:04:17 and you will get best results.
1:04:20 Work diligently, work ardently,
1:04:23 work patiently and persistently,
1:04:26 patiently and persistently,
1:04:29 and come out of all your bondages,
1:04:32 all your miseries,
1:04:35 to enjoy real peace, real harmony,
1:04:38 real happiness, real happiness.

1:06:00 and then you work again, start working again,
1:06:03 take rest for about five minutes.
