0:28 the fifth day over
0:32 world you have now five more left to
0:40 work half of the period is
0:44 gone whatever is gone is gone whatever
0:47 is left a wise person always makes best
0:52 use of whatever time is available these
0:56 next 5
0:58 days are very valuable for
1:03 you quite a few
1:06 students when they come to a course like
1:10 this initially they remain little
1:15 [Laughter]
1:18 confused because always one have some
1:20 concept of meditation meditation should
1:22 be like this like this verbalization
1:26 visualization imagination contemplation
1:29 and look nothing is there we are just
1:32 asked to observe respiration respiration
1:34 now this sensation what we are doing
1:37 some confusion is there but one day
1:41 after the other one day after the
1:43 other partly by listening to these
1:46 evening talks dama
1:49 talks partly you questioning the
1:51 assistant teachers and their
1:54 answers but mostly because of your own
1:58 practice by practice you start realizing
2:01 that there is some
2:03 something sensible in
2:06 it not that all the confusion goes away
2:09 but at least by the time one reaches the
2:11 fifth day one feels like giving a fair
2:14 trial to the technique although
2:16 everything looks quite
2:18 new we have never heard a meditation of
2:21 this
2:22 type but let us give a fair trial and
2:25 let us
2:27 work and we have found most of the
2:29 students after 5
2:31 days they start working very
2:35 seriously work very
2:38 seriously as the technique wants you to
2:42 work understanding it properly what you
2:45 doing and why you are doing
2:49 so this is not a right or a ritual or a
2:52 religious
2:54 ceremony making round from the top of
2:57 the head to the tips of the toes
3:00 and now from tonight you will work both
3:03 ways from the tips of the toes to the
3:05 top of the head both ways not a right or
3:08 a ritual not that some Buddha above the
3:12 clouds is there with the Ledger
3:15 portfolio of each individual student how
3:18 many times what how many rounds this
3:20 person has done Mr a how many
3:23 rounds Miss B how many rounds Mrs C how
3:27 many
3:28 rounds more the round the bigger the
3:31 gate is open nothing like
3:33 that nothing like that there is nobody
3:37 to open the gates for
3:38 you you have to open your own
3:41 Gates you have to knock at the door and
3:45 the door will get open for you knock at
3:48 the door of the Kingdom of Heaven
3:51 within the brahic plane within the
3:55 niic truth
3:58 within each individual as to
4:01 work the purpose of moving from head to
4:04 feet and feet to
4:06 head is to develop your faculty faculty
4:11 of
4:13 awareness not just awareness of the
4:15 reality at the surface level of the Mind
4:18 in which you remain
4:21 involved at every sense
4:24 St a reality at the deeper level of the
4:28 Mind when you start working with the
4:30 sensations on the
4:33 body you start moving to the deeper
4:36 levels of your mind the so-called
4:38 unconscious mind which is actually never
4:41 unconscious it is always conscious of
4:44 the sensations on the body and it keeps
4:47 on reacting to the
4:50 sensations if it finds sensation
4:52 Pleasant then it reacts with clinging
4:54 craving if it finds a sensation
4:57 unpleasant then avorion hatate
5:00 this has become a habit
5:02 pattern of the deepest level of the mind
5:06 it always remains a prisoner of
5:08 it a blind habit pattern whatever one
5:13 understands at the surface level of the
5:15 Mind carry no meaning for this deepest
5:18 layer of the
5:19 mind at the intellectual level one
5:22 understands that I should not generate
5:24 negativity every negativity goes against
5:27 my own peace my own Harmony it is no
5:29 good but all that understanding of the
5:33 intellect does not help this deepest
5:35 level of the mind there's a big barrier
5:38 barrier between the two now this
5:41 technique helps you to break that
5:43 barrier whatever was being felt by the
5:47 deepest level of the Mind Pleasant
5:49 sensation unpleasant sensation is now
5:52 felt by the entire mind the whole mind
5:55 is now awakened awakened to the reality
5:58 of the Body Sensations
6:00 and whatever was understood by the
6:02 surface level of the mind don't react
6:04 with negativity don't react with
6:05 negativity now it is getting understood
6:08 by the deeper level of the Mind the
6:10 barrier is getting
6:12 broken it is for this
6:15 purpose there were many techniques
6:19 prevailing in India 25 centuries back
6:23 and one who became Buddha before became
6:25 becoming Buddha he gave trial to nearly
6:28 all of them
6:31 many of them had their own good
6:33 qualities they gave benefit but then he
6:37 found that the roots of the
6:40 impurities which are lying at the
6:42 deepest level of the Mind are not even
6:44 touched to take them out as far away he
6:47 called them
6:50 anaa means impurities kesa means misery
6:54 anush is sleeping misery sleeping
6:57 impurities they are like sleeping
6:58 volcanos
7:00 the roots are there and they keep crying
7:03 keep crying any time there will be
7:06 volcanic eruption and one gets
7:08 overpowered
7:09 overwhelmed one is not liberated you
7:12 realize that unless these roots are
7:14 taken out totally I don't call myself a
7:17 liberated person and he discovered this
7:21 work with the Body Sensations you
7:23 started with respiration because
7:25 respiration takes you progressively
7:27 towards the awareness of the body sens
7:31 body sensation is so
7:34 important and as you proceed on the path
7:37 it will become clearer and clearer why
7:40 these Body
7:43 Sensations you are training the deeper
7:46 level of your mind not to react and it
7:49 never reacts to outside object the
7:52 deeper level of the mind has nothing to
7:54 do what you heard or what you have seen
7:57 or what you have smelled or what you
7:58 have tasted or what you touched or what
8:00 you thought nothing doing this deepest
8:03 layer of the mind is constantly in touch
8:06 with the body sensation of course with
8:08 all these outside objects when they come
8:11 in contact with the sense doors they
8:14 create a sensation because this part of
8:15 the mind when it gives evaluation good
8:18 bad that kind of sensation starts in the
8:21 body this mind the deepest level of the
8:24 Mind only feels Body Sensations
8:28 experiences body Sensations and keeps on
8:30 reacting day and night day and night how
8:33 to change the behavior pattern of the
8:35 deepest level of the
8:38 mind the whole exercise is for this
8:40 purpose to change the behavior pattern
8:44 of the root level of the
8:48 mind there is misery of course it cannot
8:52 be denied misery is there how to come
8:55 out of
8:57 misery how to get liberated from all the
9:02 miseries the life is full of Misery the
9:05 world is full of misery every
9:10 individual is miserable due to this
9:12 reason or that reason this apparent
9:13 reason that apparent
9:17 reason first important
9:20 thing is to accept the truth that there
9:23 is misery and misery is
9:26 universal and not merely accept it at
9:29 the intellectual level learn how to
9:31 observe misery as
9:35 misery when you learn how to observe
9:38 misery and misery this universal truth
9:41 of misery becomes a Noble
9:44 Truth first Noble Truth Noble Truth in
9:48 the sense that anyone who starts
9:51 observing misery as Mis
9:54 objectively without reacting to
9:58 it sooner or later becomes a noble
10:01 person becomes a saintly person becomes
10:05 a liberated person becomes an
10:06 enlightened person this is the first
10:09 step accept the reality of the misery
10:12 and start observing it observe it don't
10:15 react to it just observe just
10:19 observe this is what you started
10:23 doing Maj of you are sitting for 1
10:28 hour
10:30 for half an hour you somehow
10:32 manage and after that the real misery
10:36 starts oh s
10:38 pain s pain somehow you manage another
10:43 15
10:44 minutes and then the real torture
10:47 starts big
10:51 torture someone comes to me and says
10:54 Kaji the whole path is so good the
10:56 technique is so
10:58 nice I like it very
11:00 much and your discourse is evening
11:02 wonderful I like so much but take out
11:06 this 1 hour setting this is
11:08 not just take it out everything else is
11:12 so wonderful I
11:13 [Laughter]
11:16 enjoy I would also like to take it out
11:19 but it doesn't work you have to face you
11:22 have to face and after 45 minutes when
11:25 it becomes real
11:27 torture every minute is like an hour 1
11:30 hour is gone 1 minute 1 Hour 1 minute 1
11:35 hour it looks
11:37 now one hour is over and yet what a Pity
11:41 I can't open my eyes and look at my
11:43 watch what a Pity s it is more than 1
11:46 hour these assistant teachers they have
11:49 forgotten to give the
11:52 signal and then suddenly you hear this
11:57 chanting
12:00 wonderful so
12:04 melodious this chanting is so enchanting
12:07 for you so
12:10 Wonder Still Still 5 minutes more to go
12:14 you can't open your hands you can't open
12:16 your eyes you can't open your legs but
12:18 these 5
12:19 minutes doesn't matter happy now I'll
12:23 come out of this bound soon I will come
12:26 out of this
12:27 bound oh the misery of
12:30 bondage and the happiness of
12:33 Liberation you experience
12:36 both and the whole path is how to come
12:39 out of the misery the bondage of
12:42 misery why all
12:46 this many times in life you might be put
12:50 in a corner where you have to face
12:52 misery you can't do anything how to face
12:55 it maybe physical maybe mental how to
12:58 face it you're learning now and not only
13:01 that the Equanimity that you are
13:04 training your mind to remain
13:06 equanimous when everything is very
13:08 pleasant no pain you say I'm very quen
13:11 look I'm not reacting when a real pain
13:14 starts and you are equanimous maybe you
13:17 are equanimous just for a few moments
13:20 rest of the time you're reacting you're
13:21 reacting those few moments are so strong
13:25 the Equanimity is so strong it starts
13:28 cutting the root of your problem even
13:31 though you get only few moments in that
13:32 one
13:33 hour those few moments will turn into
13:36 few seconds they will turn into few
13:40 minutes and it happens sometimes a
13:42 student comes and tells me I now started
13:45 enjoying my pain you start enjoying your
13:48 pain because you stopped reacting to the
13:51 pain the pain was physical pain and you
13:54 multiplied it by making it a mental pain
13:58 if the mental part goes away and there's
13:59 a physical pain and you just observe it
14:02 it has become half then it will become
14:04 quarter it will become less less less
14:06 you start coming out of it you have to
14:08 learn how to observe your pain now the
14:11 pain is so intense it starts
14:13 overpowering you this had been the old
14:15 habit
14:17 pattern You observe as you reach this
14:19 area say s pain
14:22 here like a doctor comes and examines
14:25 doctor has no pain he just examines here
14:27 there is more pain less pain you also
14:30 examine like this don't identify
14:31 yourself with the pain pain is pain
14:34 there's a pain so what I observe now
14:36 where is the center of the pain and how
14:39 far is the influence of the pain oh here
14:41 it is more influence more pain then less
14:43 pain less pain less pain no more pain
14:46 more pain more pain less pain less pain
14:48 no like you divide the area dissect the
14:50 area next round again You observe you
14:53 find along with pain there is something
14:55 else maybe pressure then you start
14:58 dividing and iting the area
14:59 pressure-wise this is the center of the
15:01 pressure more pressure here less
15:03 pressure here less pressure here go on
15:06 and like this you
15:07 divide and you may reach a stage where
15:09 you find along with that there is heat
15:12 maybe along with that there is pulsation
15:15 and you will reach the stage where you
15:17 will find in spite of the severe pain
15:19 there is a undercurrent of vibration
15:21 which is throughout the body and once
15:23 you reach that St pain is no pain for
15:26 you it cannot overpower you don't expect
15:28 to this to happen tomorrow morning you
15:30 to take time you to take time but learn
15:33 how to observe most of the time you'll
15:35 be
15:35 reacting because of your old habit
15:38 pattern to react but you will get few
15:40 moments not to react not to react those
15:43 moments when you are not reacting then
15:45 this misery becomes a Noble Truth the
15:48 first Noble Truth you are observing it
15:52 objectively as you learn observing the
15:55 misery
15:57 objectively you are going going deeper
15:59 and deeper at the experiential level you
16:01 are going deeper and deeper to the
16:04 second Noble Truth the deep cause of the
16:08 misery at the surface level
16:12 everyone says I'm miserable because of
16:15 some external cause so and so said
16:18 something which I don't like I became
16:20 miserable so and so did something I
16:22 don't like I became miserable or
16:24 something desirable did not happen in
16:26 the life I became miserable
16:29 these are all external causes they are
16:31 true but very apparent very surface
16:34 level and without understanding the real
16:37 cause inside one keeps on using all the
16:40 strength all the energy to rectify
16:43 things outside which is not
16:46 possible one cannot change others one
16:49 may keep on trying even if one changes
16:51 one where is the guarantee that somebody
16:54 else will not raise the head and do
16:56 something against you keep some
16:58 happening entire life wanted things may
17:01 happen unwanted things may happen most
17:03 of the time unwanted things happen and
17:05 you to face all that and go deeper and
17:08 find out the real cause of your misery
17:11 this technique helps you to go to that
17:14 depth and find out the real cause misery
17:17 is not outside outside are only sensual
17:20 objects misery starts inside and when
17:24 misery starts inside there must be some
17:26 cause inside which makes one able and
17:29 that as you go deeper deeper
17:32 deeper you start understanding it not
17:35 just because of these discourses not
17:37 because you read some scriptures or
17:39 books or you intellectualize the reality
17:41 nothing doing with your own experience
17:43 you start understanding this is the Deep
17:45 rooted cause of my misery and you start
17:48 observing the Deep rooted
17:51 cause the second Noble Truth the cause
17:55 of the misery the real cause of the
17:57 misery
17:59 when these two are realized the work
18:01 becomes easy like someone is sick and a
18:04 doctor comes the first important duty of
18:07 the doctor is to find out what the
18:09 disease is the Doctor Who Cannot find
18:12 out what the disease is cannot cure the
18:14 patient first important thing what the
18:17 disease is and the second important
18:19 thing what is the deepest cause of this
18:22 disease not just symptoms of the surface
18:26 if the doctor keeps on dealing with the
18:28 symp symptoms at the surface level this
18:30 doctor can never cure the disease one
18:32 has to go to the depth the cause the
18:34 real cause of the disease then it
18:36 becomes easy you find out a way to
18:39 eradicate the cause once the cause is
18:41 eradicated the disease gets eradicated
18:45 so by this technique You observe the
18:47 real cause and by this technique you
18:49 learn how to eradicate this real cause
18:52 of misery and when that is eradicated
18:55 the third Noble Truth No More misery now
18:58 and then the whole process how you have
19:01 went to the depth and taken out the
19:03 cause of your misery and the misery
19:05 itself the fourth Noble Truth all these
19:08 are not merely to be intellectualized of
19:10 course one must understand at the
19:12 intellectual level but all these has to
19:16 be experienced at the actual
19:19 level then only they start working and
19:22 this is what you started doing going
19:24 deeper deeper deeper now just it is
19:27 beginning there's pain there is
19:29 suffering or it is pain because I am
19:31 sitting for a long time and then slowly
19:34 you will understand there is pain
19:35 because I have made this physical pain
19:37 also as a mental pain if I learn how
19:40 just to observe it the pain becomes less
19:43 and as you keep on observing observing
19:45 you start coming out of it again surface
19:47 you to go much deeper much deeper what
19:50 is happening all around what is
19:53 happening why there is so much of Misery
19:56 all
19:57 around
19:58 it becomes clearer and
20:01 clearer there is
20:05 craving
20:07 craving you want something to happen
20:09 according to your wishes it does not
20:13 happen you want to get rid of something
20:15 which you don't like it do not
20:18 happen craving and the tremendous amount
20:21 of attachment towards this habit of
20:23 craving craving
20:25 craving it becomes clearer and clearer
20:27 as you go deeper deeper deeper
20:31 deeper the law which is working inside
20:35 is also working outside the law is the
20:38 same it does not make any difference
20:41 there is misery and it becomes clear
20:44 look the Life starts with
20:46 misery you are entering in the field of
20:50 misery from the time when a Sten birth
20:52 when is entering in the field of misery
20:55 a
20:55 desire very soon this desire turns into
20:58 craving clinging and when becomes very
21:03 agitated a child cries I want milk I
21:06 want
21:07 water and cries cries because this is
21:10 the only language the child knows and
21:13 from then onwards as one grows grows
21:16 grows this unwanted things happen that
21:18 unwanted things happen this wanted
21:19 things do not happen that wanted thing
21:21 do not happen as one grows grows grows
21:24 some disease some disease or the other
21:28 life entry of the life is duka in the
21:30 language of those days it was
21:33 said the birth the life beginning of the
21:36 life is entering the field of
21:42 du you come in contact with the
21:45 disease and when one is in contact with
21:48 the disease one is so
21:50 miserable this disease is so bad I can
21:53 bear any other disease but not this
21:56 because you don't have any other disease
21:58 which disease is a pleasure every
22:01 disease is a suffering misery
22:05 misery and one keeps in contact coming
22:08 in contact this disease or de disease
22:10 this disease or de
22:12 disease one keeps on growing growing
22:15 decaying decaying becoming old old the
22:18 old age is a great misery
22:22 J great
22:24 misery a 100y old man 100 year old
22:29 woman suffering from this disease or
22:32 that disease this weakness that weakness
22:34 the old age so many
22:37 problems and then praise to God Almighty
22:40 oh God Almighty please send death so
22:44 that I relieved of all this misery you
22:46 don't have scarcity of death please give
22:48 me death praise praise and next the
22:51 doctor comes and examines old lady now
22:53 your time has come maybe by tomorrow you
22:55 have to quit old man by tomorrow you
22:58 might have to quit and the old lady and
23:00 the old man oh no no doctor I made a
23:03 wrong prayer I don't want to die I don't

23:08 grandson my great great great grandson I
23:11 have to do this I have to do that please
23:12 save me somehow I don't want to die
23:15 death is a great misery
23:22 greaty what else this man he was not
23:25 playing a intellectual game sitting
23:27 under the tree he was experiencing the
23:30 truth inside why what is the cause of
23:33 misery going deeper deeper deeper a
23:36 reality
23:39 came oh whatever we
23:42 desire the desire is not
23:45 fulfilled one becomes miserable sitting
23:49 you have a desire that the pain should
23:51 go away and the pain does not go you
23:53 become so miserable sitting and you want
23:56 lot of ense stion of bliss ecstasy is
24:00 not coming and you're
24:02 miserable
24:05 oh whatever you desire you're not
24:07 getting it you become
24:10 miserable unwanted person unwanted
24:14 situation unwanted things you get
24:17 associated with them associated with
24:19 them wanted things wanted person want a
24:22 situation you get disassociated
24:25 disassociated big misery big misery
24:28 he was understanding all that deep
24:30 inside and then going deeper deeper
24:33 deeper he came to the stage where it
24:35 became so
24:44 clear at the depth in short the misery
24:48 is these five Aggregates one aggregate
24:52 is the material aggregate the subatomic
24:54 particles the entire body made of
24:56 subatomic particles
24:58 kalapas and four other Aggregates mental
25:01 Aggregates cognizing part of the Mind
25:03 recognizing part of the Mind feeling
25:05 part of the mind and reacting part of
25:07 the Mind these five together has made
25:10 this personality I and tremendous amount
25:14 of attachment towards it upan upan is
25:17 attachment
25:18 clinging all these five Aggregates a
25:21 result of the clinging clinging and one
25:24 keeps on clinging to these five
25:26 Aggregates and like this one keeps on
25:28 rolling in misery rolling in misery it
25:30 was becoming clearer and clearer this
25:33 aadan clinging
25:36 attachment there are four basic
25:39 attachments one attachment is towards
25:42 this eye an imaginary eye without
25:45 knowing what is this eye an imaginary
25:47 eye the subatomic
25:49 particles the mass of the subatomic
25:52 particle is this ey and yet one keeps on
25:56 saying this as I I
25:58 those four
25:59 Aggregates the cognizing part of the
26:02 mind cognizes and passes away it
26:05 cognizes passes away is this ey
26:08 recognizing part of the Mind recognizes
26:10 and passes away is this ey the feeling
26:13 part of the Mind feels and passes away
26:15 is this ey the reacting part of the Mind
26:17 reacts and passes away is this ey or the
26:20 five join together is ey but I is so
26:24 important always a capital ey
26:28 anyone says one word against this eye
26:30 one feels so irritated so
26:33 agitated without understanding what is
26:35 this eye an imaginary eye a created eye
26:38 and yet so much attachment to this eye
26:42 someone does one work against this ey
26:44 and again one feels so irritated so
26:46 agitated so unhappy I I I tremendous
26:51 amount of attachment towards this
26:53 ey brings nothing but misery nothing but
26:57 misery
26:59 then this fear this circle of I starts

28:42 dollars makes no difference how much
28:44 attachment is there that much misery is
28:47 bound to come the deeper the attachment
28:51 the deeper the misery the stronger the
28:52 attachment the stronger the misery this
28:55 is law of nature it will become clearer
28:58 and clearer as you practice more and
29:00 more attachment clinging is bound to
29:03 bring misery nothing but
29:05 misery one
29:08 incident I was new to India in those
29:11 days having come to BMA within it was
29:13 within two or 3 years there were no
29:15 centers so those who were eager for the
29:18 spread of this technique to different
29:20 people who are miserable they used to
29:22 arrange some site
29:25 somewhere a mosque a 10
29:28 Temple a church things like that or
29:31 maybe school or something one course was
29:33 arranged in a remote Village which was a
29:36 pilgrim center of the Janes a Jane

32:32 that silver trunk to her her crying stop
32:36 craving whether it is worth 20 rupees
32:38 worth of article or 20 million makes no
32:40 difference as much as clinging is there

32:46 misery is bound to be there bound to be
32:48 there I m i my whether you use these
32:52 words or not doesn't matter but this I
32:54 my and your attachment to it full of
32:57 misery full of
32:59 misery I remember another incident again
33:02 in a very remote Village of Northern
33:06 India a very learned monk
33:10 participated after five or six days he
33:12 comes to me go Kaji between 12 and 1 you
33:16 gave interviews to the
33:18 students and just 10 minutes in those
33:20 days students were less so I used to
33:22 give 10 minutes to each student 10
33:23 minutes for these householders what
33:26 questions they have got even 10 minutes
33:28 is too much for them I'm a monk recluse
33:31 I've got so many questions please give
33:33 me half an hour I said Rend sir I know
33:36 you'll be talking about philosophies and
33:38 all that and I'm not interested I can't
33:40 give you time oh no no going Kaji last 5
33:42 days or so I have understood all these
33:45 philosophical talks are useless I will
33:47 talk only about about the technique
33:50 about the technique why you require half
33:52 an hour for technique no no please give
33:55 me half an hour all right somehow I
33:56 managed come and he came 2 3 5 minutes
34:00 he talked about the technique and
34:01 suddenly the topic was changed subject
34:03 was changed go Kaji from that big city
34:06 from he from which he came go Kaji in
34:09 that big city your are Monastery my
34:12 Monastery monasteries are always for the
34:14 monks not for the householders I'm a
34:16 householder how can I have Monastery go
34:18 Kaji try to understand your Monastery
34:21 Reverend sir I can't have a monastery I
34:24 am a householder and I carry such a
34:26 colosal proof testimonial the I'm
34:30 householder how can I have a
34:34 monastery and he keeps on saying go Kaji
34:37 you are Monastery you are monaster and
34:39 after that he says go Kaji in you are
34:41 Monastery you are elephant my elephant
34:44 what is's talking and then suddenly it
34:47 clicked in my mind this is India a
34:50 wonderful country a vast country having
34:53 so many Traditions there is a tradition
34:55 some people have a strong belief
34:57 that throughout the life we don't use
34:59 this dirty word I and mine we don't use
35:02 whenever I have to say I I will say you
35:05 whenever I have to say mine I will say
35:06 your ah now I understand yes Reverend
35:10 sir my Monastery my elephant go ahead
35:13 what went
35:15 wrong look he's a recluse renounced
35:19 everything he is built a monastery in
35:22 the midst of the
35:24 city without the permission of the
35:26 council or
35:27 municipality and now order has come they
35:29 will smash it they will break
35:31 it and in the midst of the city elephant
35:34 is not allowed to be kept there so
35:36 orderers come to take it out and from
35:38 somewhere he learned that the Lord mayor
35:41 of the municipality of that City had
35:43 been to BMA and had stayed with me as my
35:46 guest so go Ki just a few words from you
35:50 and you are monast will be saved your
35:52 elephant will be saved it doesn't use
35:55 the word I doesn't use the word mine
35:57 but tremendous amount of attachment
36:00 attachment is bound to bring misery
36:02 nothing but misery misery deeper the
36:05 attachment deeper the misery is bound to
36:08 be there would not have been any misery
36:12 if I develop attachment to this eye and
36:14 this eye remains Eternal all the time
36:17 and I develop attachment to the mind and
36:19 this mind remains Eternal there's no
36:21 misery but the trouble is this eye does
36:25 not remain eternal
36:27 mine does not remain Eternal whatever I
36:29 say mine mine mine mine passes away and
36:31 I'm helpless I can't do anything or if
36:34 this Remains the so-call I passes away
36:36 and I'm helpless a departure a
36:39 separation is bound to come and that
36:42 brings so much misery if the attachment
36:44 is there if the clinging is there the
36:46 misery is so
36:48 great another attachment one develops
36:50 main is this I turns into mine and then
36:54 my views my philosophy opy my Dogma my
36:59 belief My Religion my tradition
37:02 tremendous amount of
37:04 attachment one does not understand that
37:06 I am wearing colored glasses and I have
37:09 got attachment towards the color of the
37:10 glass if I wear red color glass for me
37:13 everything is red red red somebody is
37:15 wearing green color glass for him
37:16 everything is green green Green we keep
37:18 on fighting with each other I can't
37:20 convince him that it is all red he can't
37:22 convince me that is all green we keep on
37:24 fighting break break each other's head
37:26 still we can't come to terms because the
37:28 attachment and the attachment is to the
37:31 color we don't see things as they are
37:34 this big attachment brings big misery
37:37 then in some cases there is attachment
37:39 towards rights rituals ceremonies
37:43 Etc not here I've seen But back in the
37:46 East people are so very much attached to
37:49 their daily rights their daily rituals
37:51 they come to the course and they say why
37:52 you stop these rights rituals give me
37:54 just 15 minutes I finish my right and
37:56 then come and meditate and you say no
37:58 they become so agitated because of that
38:00 later on of course they start realizing
38:02 but initially because of the attachment
38:04 The Miser is there these four big
38:07 attachments make us so miserable so
38:10 miserable and he was there to go deeper
38:17 deeper why after all this
38:20 attachment and it became clearer and
38:24 clearer a c cing
38:28 arises craving for something that you
38:31 want you want to possess you want to
38:35 retain and it very soon turns into
38:38 clinging
38:41 attachment a
38:44 craving you want to get rid of something
38:46 you don't like
38:48 it and tremendous amount of attachment
38:50 towards this craving you don't want it
38:53 you want to get rid of it and yet you
38:54 can't get rid of it oh
38:57 the craving turns into clinging into
39:00 attachment and the misery
39:02 starts why this
39:04 craving he was not playing a
39:06 intellectual game he was not reading
39:08 scriptures or discussing scriptures he
39:11 was experimenting like a scientist what
39:12 is happening deep
39:14 inside a small little desire
39:17 starts you start liking it and how
39:20 quickly it turns into
39:22 craving a small little desire to get rid
39:26 of something which turns into a
39:28 verion oh Taha in the language of those
39:33 days craving
39:37 means craving turns into clinging small
39:41 little desires turn into craving and
39:44 craving into clinging why these small
39:46 little desires even what is the cause it
39:49 became so clear because he was
39:51 experiencing
39:55 it these Sensations on the body when one
39:59 experiences Sensations on the body and
40:02 if the sensation is Pleasant you start
40:05 liking it which very soon turns into
40:07 craving clinging when the sensation is
40:10 unpleasant when you experience
40:11 unpleasant sensation very soon it turns
40:13 into avorion hatred you like to get rid
40:15 of it the craving is to get rid of it oh
40:19 the
40:22 sensations means the cause the V mean
40:25 sensation s
40:27 is the cause of your craving which turns
40:29 into
40:30 clinging why these Sensations what is
40:33 the cause he was experimenting what
40:35 what's
40:39 happening there is a contact and as soon
40:42 as there is a contact there is bound to
40:44 be a sensation on the body contact of
40:47 what with what the six sense does the
40:51 eyes contact of the eyes with some shape
40:54 some form some color some light the
40:56 object of the eyes as it comes in
40:58 contact there's bound to be a sensation
41:01 object of the ear sense door a sound
41:03 comes in contact with the ear sense door
41:05 there's bound to be a sensation nose
41:07 sense door a smell coming in contact
41:09 bound to be a sensation tongue sense
41:11 door A Taste coming in contact bound to
41:13 be sensation body sorry body sense door
41:17 there is a contact of something tangible
41:18 bound to be a sensation and the mind
41:21 send St any thought any emotion there is
41:24 bound to be a sensation on the body
41:27 contct why this contact and it was so
41:30 simple so
41:33 clear means contact means the six sense
41:37 doors so long as one is having these six
41:39 sense doors the respective objects the
41:42 entire world is full of respective
41:44 objects there is bound to be one contact
41:46 or the other at one sense door or the
41:47 other the contact is because of the six
41:50 sense doors that we carry and their
41:52 respective objects in the world why the
41:55 six sense doors what is the cause of
41:57 this so
42:02 clear means the mental structure Rupa
42:05 means the physical structure the
42:07 combination of these two as soon as this
42:09 combination started that means the life
42:11 flow started the Continuum of the life
42:14 started it started with these six s
42:18 TOS why this mind and matter life
42:20 started like this and it was so
42:25 clear
42:26 this flow of Consciousness is there all
42:28 the
42:29 time and as soon as one life ends this
42:32 flow of Consciousness comes in contact
42:34 arises somewhere else it keeps on
42:36 arising passing arising passing at the
42:38 time of death it passes then again it
42:40 arises Somewhere In Another Life another
42:43 body and starts flowing in the same
42:47 way why this what is the cause of it and
42:50 it was so
42:55 clear this this mental volutional
42:57 actions that you take place all mental
42:59 volutional action are responsible for
43:02 the consciousness of the next moment
43:04 this moment I generate a Sankara this
43:06 word you'll be listening again and again
43:08 Sankara the mental volutional action
43:11 when you generate Sankara next moment
43:14 Consciousness arises you generate
43:15 Sankara next moment Consciousness arises
43:18 at the time of death a very deep
43:21 shankara which is like a deep line drawn
43:23 on the rock with chisel and Hammer that
43:26 arises on the surface gives a strong
43:28 push and the Consciousness arises
43:30 somewhere else so the flow continues
43:32 because of the shankara why this Shara
43:36 and it was so
43:39 clear oh ignorance ignorance everybody
43:43 is generating Sankara because of
43:45 ignorance what ignorance not ignorant
43:48 because one has not gone to any school
43:50 or college not ignorant because one has
43:52 not read scriptures not ignorant because
43:55 one has not
43:56 listen to dma talks nothing doing
43:59 ignorance at the experiential level one
44:02 does not know how the misery is arising
44:06 deep inside how there are Sensations
44:08 everywhere and how pleasant sensation
44:11 one reacts with the Sara of craving how
44:13 unpleasant sensation one keeps on
44:15 reacting with the Sara of aversion this
44:17 whole process continues deep inside and
44:20 one at the surface level doesn't know
44:21 anything what is happening and this
44:23 process of multiplication generating
44:26 misery multiplying misery generating
44:27 misery generating Sara multiplying Sara
44:31 oh ignorance
44:33 ignorance the whole chain became so
44:36 clear every link was so
44:41 clear because of ignorance one
44:47 generat because of there is the
44:53 Consciousness because of the
44:54 Consciousness a new life life in mind
44:56 and matter
44:59 starts with this mind and matter six
45:02 sense doors are
45:05 there because of that the contact is
45:08 there
45:10 and and because of the Conta a sensation
45:13 is there
45:15 and and because of the sensation a
45:18 craving is
45:23 there and this craving turns into
45:26 clinging into deep
45:30 attachment and because of this deep
45:34 attachment to the craving the process of
45:37 b b means flow of Life the flow of Life
45:41 keeps on flowing flowing it gets all the
45:44 strength every time one comes to the end
45:46 of the life this B the shankara which is
45:50 so deep is called bankar which is
45:52 responsible to give a new life so the
45:55 process of becoming becoming becoming
45:57 continues it does not stop at the end of
46:00 the life it
46:03 continues and because of this process of
46:05 becoming becoming becoming even after
46:08 death A New Life Starts Jai again a life
46:11 a birth comes and when the birth
46:22 comes whenever Life Starts it has to
46:25 pass through all these miseries miseries
46:28 of old age misery of disease misery of
46:31 death misery of wanted things have not
46:33 happening unwanted things happening all
46:36 kinds of physical and mental miseries
46:38 one has to pass because the birth has
46:40 started it became so clear the whole
46:43 process became so clear which can become
46:46 clear with anybody who goes deeper
46:48 deeper deeper
46:49 deeper getting rid of the ignorance
46:52 understanding the truth understanding
46:53 the truth of the experiential level now
46:56 it was clear how this process of misery
47:00 how it starts how it keeps on
47:01 multiplying multiplying how to get rid
47:04 of it how to come out of it how to break
47:08 this chain this link this chain full of
47:12 links which which link has to be broken
47:13 where the chain has to be broken a life
47:16 has started already with Nama and Rupa
47:19 that means mind and matter the flu has
47:21 started what to do shall I commit
47:24 suicide when the problem gets solved oh
47:27 no it does not get solved one does not
47:29 come out of misery when one is
47:31 committing
47:33 suicide what is the volution of the mind
47:35 at that time what's the condition of the
47:37 Mind full of Agony the last last mind of
47:41 the life is full of Agony it will
47:44 produce nothing but a new life full of
47:46 Agony the next mind is full of Agony
47:49 because it is the product of the last
47:50 mind of this life suicide does not solve
47:53 any problem one cannot come out of
47:55 misery by Suicide then when the n and
47:58 Rupa is there mind and matter is there
48:00 the life is Flowing then these six s do
48:03 I better destroy them the eyes the ears
48:06 the nose the tongue all right and then
48:08 body and then mind again it will be
48:10 suicide how to destroy them then all the
48:13 respective objects around the world
48:15 destroy them impossible how can I
48:17 destroy all that when these six toes are
48:20 there and the respective objects are
48:22 there contact is bound to be there you
48:25 can't run away from there and when the
48:27 contact is there the V the feeling the
48:30 sensation is bound to be there you can't
48:32 get rid of it and here the wisdom arose
48:36 this is the place where I can use an X
48:39 and cut the link here the V is bound to
48:42 come so long as one is alive alive
48:45 things keep on getting in contact this
48:47 door that door at least the mind and
48:49 matter keep on getting in contact every
48:51 moment and there is a sensation there's
48:53 a
48:54 sensation with
48:56 sensation because of ignorance because
48:59 of a with
49:01 sensation tan arises craving arises
49:04 aversion arises now when has to turn the
49:08 whole thing Sensation will be there but
49:10 with
49:11 sensation wisdom will arise the reality
49:16 the characteristic oh what this
49:18 sensation this is not Eternal this is
49:21 not permanent it is a reason to pass
49:23 away look let me observe how long it
49:25 lasts and yes it arises it passes away
49:27 it arises it passes away how unpleasant
49:30 a sensation may be it is bound to pass
49:32 away how pleasant sensation maybe it is
49:35 bound to pass away no purpose is served
49:37 to react what what is the purpose of
49:40 reacting to something which is by nature
49:43 passing away there's no meaning there's
49:45 no no purpose is served no sense in that
49:49 it becomes clearer and clearer oh coming
49:53 to the stage where the sensations are
49:55 being being experienced and not reacting
49:58 to the sensations will turn the whole
50:00 process of the multiplication of misery
50:03 and the process of Liberation starts he
50:06 found out the sensation as a important
50:09 point from where a sort of Junction from
50:12 where two roads start one road is he
50:18 said a road which is full of misery you
50:22 generate misery you keep on generating
50:23 misery because this you keep on reacting
50:27 every moment you you are experiencing
50:29 sensation every moment you are reacting
50:31 so it is a process of multiplication of
50:34 misery multiplication of misery and this
50:37 very Junction this very point of your
50:39 sensation on the body can take you to
50:41 the road which is the road of
50:46 Liberation all your misery will get
50:48 eradicated because now when you
50:51 experience the sensation you don't react
50:54 you just understand
50:56 an or impermanent or impermanent this is
51:00 what you started doing first important
51:03 thing is that you have to be aware of
51:05 the sensations and when you are aware of
51:08 the sensations not to react every
51:11 sensation should turn into PA that means
51:14 vi v PA every sensation must result in
51:20 wisdom not every sensation to result in
51:23 tanha craving and aversion this is the
51:26 path that you chosen for Liberation
51:28 going deeper to the level of sensation
51:31 and not reacting the whole chain is
51:33 broken here and you find the entire
51:35 chain gets broken because there is no
51:37 more ignorance
51:44 now when ignorance get
51:48 eradicated there's no more you don't
51:54 generate then there's no more the flow
51:57 of Consciousness will
52:00 stop then there is no more flow of mind
52:06 and no more
52:10 six no more
52:14 Conta no more
52:18 sensation no more
52:21 craing no more
52:24 clinging
52:27 no more the process of becoming becoming
52:31 becoming no more
52:42 new all the miseries that follow the
52:44 birth they automatically go
52:48 away easy to understand one may accept
52:52 at the intellectual level but doesn't
52:54 help one to practice go to the depth
52:57 where there are
52:58 Sensations and you're not reacting there
53:01 are Sensations you're not reacting and
53:03 merely accepting it at the theoretical
53:06 level does not help even someone may not
53:09 believe in past life or future life
53:10 doesn't matter that's not very important
53:13 that you must first accept this past
53:14 life and future life then only will
53:16 technique will help when us to accept
53:17 the present life it is there and every
53:21 moment you are generating misery for
53:23 yourself every moment you're generating
53:24 a Sankar and every Shara is a misery for
53:26 you and you keep on repeating the Shara
53:28 repeating the shankara making it so deep
53:31 deep line deep inside like a line down
53:33 on the rock with chisel and Hammer so
53:35 deep more and more misery deeper and
53:37 deeper misery at least you start coming
53:39 out of it you started coming out of that
53:41 misery your present misery law of nature
53:44 is such when you stop generating a new
53:48 Sankara with the experience of sensation
53:50 on the body the old ones will start
53:53 coming up on the surface all your
53:55 accumulation of the past which lie low
53:59 which are in the storehouse deep inside
54:01 they will start coming up and as they
54:03 come up they will come up with some
54:05 sensation or the other and as they come
54:07 up again you are equanimous you're not
54:08 reacting they lose the strength they
54:11 become feebler and Feer and pass away
54:13 another big chunk of P shankaras will
54:15 come with this sensation or that
54:16 sensation again you equanimous like this
54:18 the old ones will get eradicated once
54:21 you stop generating new shankaras the
54:24 old ones automatic Al get eradicated
54:26 little by little as much as you are
54:28 equanimous they come on the surface they
54:30 get eradicated they come on the surface
54:32 they get eradicated this is what we
54:37 say you'll be listening this every now
54:39 and then this words
54:43 of every is
54:45 so Rising
54:48 passing arising and passing away arising
54:51 and passing away is its
54:54 nature but when it passes away again it
54:56 arises it multiplies and again it arises
55:00 but if you are aware of your Sensations
55:02 and you don't react to them
55:06 then it gets eradicated it comes on the
55:08 surface of course gets eradicated
55:11 eradicated and as much as is
55:16 eradicated that much you start enjoying
55:19 Liberation peace of Liberation happiness
55:21 of Liberation because that much misery
55:23 has gone away this is the full process
55:26 and this was the Enlightenment of this
55:28 person he found out the real cause of
55:30 misery and he found out how to get rid
55:32 of this real cause at the deepest level
55:35 the first
55:36 words when became fully enlightened the
55:40 first words of budha are so wonderful
55:42 every word of Buddha is very wonderful
55:44 but the first word what were the first
55:47 words of Buddha when he became
55:49 enlightened these Tas also you'll be
55:51 listening every day at least three times
55:53 a day and
56:23 for
56:37 now that was the night full moon night
56:40 of the month of vaka when he was sitting
56:43 under the tree observing the truth
56:45 inside as one goes deeper and deeper
56:48 purifies the Mind purifies the Mind
56:50 certain faculties of the Mind increase
56:53 one faculty is the memory of the past by
56:57 the time he was he had passed the
57:00 midnight this faculty arose he started
57:03 seeing his past not only this life the
57:06 past life second past life 10th past
57:10 life and like that kept on looking at
57:12 his past past past countless lives and
57:15 then he
57:18 says in this flow of the world I have
57:21 taken so many times birth birth after
57:23 birth birth after birth oh so many lives
57:26 countless an means countless not just
57:29 one
57:34 countless and every time I taken birth I
57:37 kept on running
57:40 running inent without stopping everyone
57:44 who takes birth keeps on running keeps
57:46 on running towards the death as soon as
57:48 you take birth you start running running
57:50 running towards the death you can't wait
57:52 even for a second let me wait now I
57:54 don't go to towards death you can't wait
57:56 you to keep on running running running
57:58 inent towards the death without
58:01 attaining anything without achieving
58:03 anything and then in some of the lives
58:05 he
58:06 found some wise people told him that all
58:10 this circle of birth and death and
58:12 misery you can come out of this provided
58:15 you can witness the Creator the great
58:18 Creator so many lives he kept on
58:21 searching this Creator who is the
58:23 creator
58:27 the creator of this
58:29 house what house every time one dies
58:31 another house is ready every time one
58:33 dies another house is
58:35 ready who creates this
58:39 house in search of the creator of the
58:44 house again and again I kept on getting
58:47 birth full of misery full of misery in
58:50 this plane or that plane everywhere
58:52 misery is there even at the highest
58:54 planes Celestial ples or brahic PLS the
58:57 misery of the old age and the misery of
58:59 death is there you are not totally out
59:01 of
59:05 misery oh builder of the house now you
59:08 are seen I've seen
59:14 you you can't build any house for me
59:17 anymore you can't build how can somebody
59:20 build a house for you they must be
59:21 building materials for that some Timber
59:24 or steel or cement or motor I destroyed
59:36 everything I have destroyed all the
59:38 building materials you can't make a
59:40 building for me what are the building
59:46 materials my mind is now free from all
59:48 the shankaras the shankaras which are
59:51 responsible for a new birth are totally
59:53 eradicated
1:00:00 and craving is rooted out there is no
1:00:03 trace of craving left so no more new
1:00:05 shankaras old shankaras are already
1:00:07 dedicated and I can't generate new
1:00:09 shankara now that is the stage of full
1:00:12 Liberation and anyone and everyone can
1:00:14 reach that stage but one has to work one
1:00:17 has to work not just by craving and not
1:00:21 just by praying not that some miracle
1:00:23 will happen and one will get liberated
1:00:25 one has to work each individual has to
1:00:27 work and work very seriously these 10
1:00:31 days you will get a technique how to
1:00:33 work how to go to the depth of the Mind
1:00:36 where you keep on generating shankara

1:00:46 you start feeling
1:00:47 Sensations there were many meditation
1:00:50 techniques at the time of Buddha before
1:00:52 Buddha and after Buddha but this was was
1:00:54 the contribution of Buddha the discovery
1:00:57 of Buddha that you cannot come out of
1:00:59 your
1:01:00 misery the whole process of misery will
1:01:03 remain unless you reach the stage where
1:01:05 Sankara is being generated where craving
1:01:07 is been generated and that is generated
1:01:09 at the level of the sensations you call
1:01:12 it vashna you call it by any name any
